            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Brethren, euer ſince my firſt entring into a Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge, I haue applied mine endeauours, by Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing to inſtruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And becauſe I would not be irregular, my Theame hath alwaies been the ſhort Catechiſme, ſet forth in the Booke of Common Prayer, a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme indeede, ſolely appointed to bee firſt taught; but to the great detriment of our Church either wholly neglected, any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred, or barely taught without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explanation, or elſe for outward formality onely in Lent ſet vpon the Table, as a diſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that Faſt. My ſtudy hath been <pb facs="tcp:767:3"/> firſt to mend this fault for my owne particular, and therefore I haue diuers yeares labored con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly throughout the yeare, by this kind of teaching to forme in my hearers ſome diſtinct knowledge of our Chriſtian Principles: and hauing at length come to my intended period, I digeſted the pith of all my Collections and Meditations into this Booke, herein imitating
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> vpon <hi>Melanctons</hi> ſhort Catechiſme, ſo vſefull to young Students in Theologie, and to other ſtudious perſons. The labour thus ended, being conſcious to my ſelf of mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, I ſuppreſſed it three or foure yeares, till that being animated by ſome of you (my Brethren) who had either ſeene or heard hereof, I haue aduentured to bring it into publike view. The worke I confeſſe is ordinary and worthles; but for forme it is alone, and ſo may craue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement. Heere are collected into one all fundamentall points, of the true Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſparſedlie handled in diuers learned Bookes, and applied to the ſhort Engliſh Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme. It is a Catechiſme and a Comentarie, the one for Children, ſhort, and fitted to their capacity, the other for men, leading to a larger mappe of Chriſtian Principles, and fitted for <pb facs="tcp:767:3"/> the edification of all. To haue written a large new Catechiſme without an old text, had bin ſuperfluous amongſt ſo many already abroad, but to write for the illuſtrating of the Text, to which we Engliſh muſt all hold vs, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. In publiſhing this, I take not vpon me to preſcribe a forme vnto any, my ſelfe being the leaſt amongſt thouſands, but I whet on all, what I can, to an vniforme proceeding by our common grounds. We haue all one God, one Chriſt, one Baptiſme, one Goſpell, and one forme of Articles of Religion, to which wee ſubſcribe; why then ſhould we not all conſent in one Catechiſme? Our Mother the Church of England, hath firſt commaunded this one Catechiſme, vpon which is my Commentary. If therefore my inward wiſhes may breake foorth into open requeſt, I would craue that it might pleaſe the right Reuerend Fathers of our Church, more ſtrictly to preſſe the teaching of our common Catechiſme in their ſeuerall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions: and you my Brethren, who doe already teach it in your ſeuerall Pariſhes, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it with all diligence, and to bring it in, and commend it to the priuate exerciſe of your people in their families, amongſt whom it <pb facs="tcp:767:4"/> hath hitherto been much neglected. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you all fauourably to accept this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act, and where I haue faulted, correct me; where I haue failed, ſupply me; where I haue done rightly, ioyne with me. If this may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, though but goats hayre, towards the Lords Sanctuary, I ſhall be glad, and giue God the glory. Our great Shepheard, the Lord Ieſus, who hath laid downe his life for his ſheepe, make this and all the endeauours of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, fruitfull paſtures for the comfort of his flocke, and for the praiſe of his holy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name.

            <p>This Primer Queſtion may bee called the way to the Church dore: it leadeth to the mention of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which is the gate of Chriſtianity. It is prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before our Catechiſme, as an Introduction, or familiar entrance, framed by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and anſwer, for the inſtruction of the ſimpler: and therefore is not idle and vnfitting, as ſome would haue it, but very agreeable to the matter intended. Inaſmuch, as a Chriſtian mans name doth not onely diſtinguiſh him from other men of different names; but alſo ſerueth for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, whereby the grace of God ſhould bee ſtirred vp in him. Thus the people had names of old: <hi>Adam,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="2" facs="tcp:767:17"/> red earth; <hi>Euah,</hi> a mother:
<hi>Abram,</hi> an high father: <hi>Iſaac,</hi> laughing: <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſupplanting: and the Lord himſelfe hath a name preſcribed,
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> a Sauiour, &amp;c. Neither were theſe names giuen by chance, but Almighty God himſelfe being the firſt guide hereunto, and many times appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the name, then holy men followed; and generally, all the world in former ages, gaue names of ſpeciall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter called the Hebrew childe drawn out of the riuer,
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Drawne-out. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, <hi>Abres,</hi> Father; when, as a Father hee prouided for the Countrey, &amp;c. A more eſpeciall day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monitory may this bee to vs, for that our name doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vnto vs our Chriſtian Profeſsion, that wee may walke worthy of the ſame. And this may ſerue for ſome direction vnto vs, in the naming of our children, that wee preferre not heathen names where other are vſuall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether may a man change his name or not?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Change of names. </note>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee may: Firſt, by Gods ſpeciall command: as <hi>Abram</hi> was changed into

Secondly, if hee bee conuerted from a falſe, to the true religion: thus <hi>Saul</hi> his name was turned into <hi>Paul:</hi> for in this caſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and heathen men haue thought vnfit to retaine the old name: When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> conſecrated <hi>Daniel</hi> vnto <hi>Bel</hi> their God, hee changed his name into <hi>Belſhazzar, Bels</hi> Treaſurer: <hi>Ananias,</hi> into

<hi>George Caſtriot</hi> of Epirus, had his name changed into
<hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg.</hi> Thirdly, a man may change his name for the glory of God, and his own ſafety, without hurt to any man. Thus <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> in the time of. King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, called himſelfe by the name of

                  <hi>Cyril: Jeruſ:</hi> ſaith, That they changed their names, as occaſion was offered. And the Ciuill Law doth allow it.</note> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> wrote two Homilies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:767:17"/> the name of <hi>Nathaniel Neſtkins:</hi> that their owne names might not hinder the Papiſts from the reading thereof: Yet this approues not the changing of names, the more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commit any villany, as was done by the late Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Nouember the fifth.</p>

As for the cuſtome of the Church;
<hi>Abraham,</hi> at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Circumciſion, is ſaid, to haue circumciſed his ſonne the eight day, and to haue called his name <hi>Iſaac,</hi>

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and this cuſtome held as long as circumciſion, as may bee ſeene in <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt: <hi>When they came to circumciſe the babe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.59.</note> 
               <hi>and called him Zacharias.</hi> And in the Lord Ieſus; <hi>When the eight dayes were accompliſhed, that they ſhould circumciſe the childe,</hi>

                  <hi>Luc.</hi>
2.21.</note> 
               <hi>his name was called Ieſus. Obiect. Gerſhom</hi> the ſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.22. 4.25.</note> was named before his circumciſion, for he was afterwards cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, when the Lord met <hi>Moſes in the Inne, and would haue ſlaine him: Rachel, Iaacobs</hi> wife,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18.</note> immediately after her trauell, named her child <hi>Benoni,</hi> and during the time of the Iſraelites being in the wilderneſſe, for forty yeeres,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſ.</hi> 5.2.</note> they were without circumciſion, but it is not likely they were without names. <hi>Sol.</hi> This laſt was an extraordinary time, neceſſitie made them diſpenſe with law; for that act of <hi>Rachels,</hi> it onely ſhewes her deſire, for the child was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called <hi>Beniamin, viz.</hi> at the circumciſion. Laſtly, for the firſt, no maruell though the cuſtome of the Church were broken, ſeeing that Gods ordinance was alſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, for feare of impatient
<hi>Zipporah.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, what fitter time can be to impoſe names, then when we begin to bee? we are firſt borne, and then haue the common name of man, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:767:18"/> then we are borne againe, and haue the ſpeciall names of Chriſtians. The ſecond thing in the anſwer; the perſons that giue the name, <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers.</hi> True it is, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were alwayes wont to propound the name. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Angell told what the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be: <hi>Zachary,</hi> of his ſonne <hi>Iohn:</hi> and ordinarily, <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Ioſeph</hi> in Aegypt (alſo <hi>Hannah</hi> named <hi>Samuel;</hi> &amp; <hi>Rachel, Ioſeph.</hi> But the Godfathers, following the direction of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, haue vſed a long time to propound the name in publique: when <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be circumciſed, it is ſaid, <hi>They call d his name,</hi> &amp;c. But his parents had the greateſt ſtroke in determining the name.<note place="margin">Obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers anſwered</note> One, writing againſt our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome herein, alledgeth the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> Can. 30.

                  </gap>chus,</hi> and out of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> that the Prieſt was wont to aske the name at the Church doore, and hence endeauoureth to proue, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and not Godfathers, are to name their children, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the time of baptiſme, but before, for which he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addeth, that they, which were <hi>Adulti,</hi> were wont to come before their baptiſme, and put their old names in the Regiſter. Vnto which I anſwere. Firſt, that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice,</hi> is a meere forgery, there being but twenty Canons in all, or two and twenty at the moſt. Secondly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be true, and that which followeth; it is no more then we confeſſe, that Parents haue, or ought to haue, the chiefeſt ſtroke in the names of their owne children. Laſtly, for the <hi>Adulti</hi> holding their own names, it might be through conniuency, in ſome particular Church, at ſome time onely. For it is moſt euident, that Godfathers were vſed amongſt Chriſtians, euen in the Primitiue Church. <hi>Higinus,</hi> Biſhop of Rome, and Martyr, ſpeakes of them in his fift Decretall, who was but 140. yeeres after Chriſts incarnation, and the beſt reformed Churches doe allow of them.

            <p>The right vnderſtanding then of this is, that in our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, we are ſacramentally, or inſtrumentally, made the children of God; and really, and truly, when we are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptized with the Holy Ghoſt; if thou beleeue, and be baptized, thou art made Inheritor of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and this is aſcribed vnto baptiſme.<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.14 </note>Wee are therefore to ſeeke for this at the hands of God, wee muſt reade, heare, and learne, that wee may bee able to ſee. Firſt, wee muſt learne the grownds of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, the Lords prayer, Creed, and ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and then diligently heare Sermons; for how ſhall wee call vpon him, of whom wee haue not heard, and how ſhall wee heare without a Preacher? Hearing the word preached then is Gods principall ordinance to begin in vs the grace of deſiring to forſake ſinne, which where it is he will ſecond with more grace, of vtterly ſhaking off the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, according to his promiſe of giuing grace for grace.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16. </note>Thirdly, wee are to conſider, what is the office which the God-fathers and God-mothers doe binde themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the behalf of themſelues. Now as hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, neither men nor Angels can effect this work of grace, it is a worke proper to God alone. Wee are not therefore to ſuppoſe that their promiſe tendeth to the full performance of this, by themſelues, as vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or infuſers of grace, but to doe what weake helpe and means may be able to do, both by their care of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if parents be negligent or departed, &amp; alſo by prayer vnto God for them. Godfathers were of old taken for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as when one is admitted to be apprentice to any trade hee muſt haue ſureties for his truſty and faithfull ſeruice: ſo was it thought fit, when men turned from heatheniſme, and were by baptiſme admitted into the order of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that ſuch as were counted faithfull, ſhould be ſureties for their conſtant and honeſt proceeding according to the ſame order, and this was done when men were of age and able to anſwer for themſelues, and hath euer ſince held to bee auailable to the ſame purpoſe, and much more neceſſary for infants, when growing vp, they ſhall be pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <pb n="11" facs="tcp:767:21"/> vnto holineſſe by them. O how greatly then are they to bee blamed, that turne this cuſtome into an idle cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by putting all care off: thus fruſtrating the intent of the Church, and deluding the congregation of Gods people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly let vs take a briefe view, what be thoſe abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which a Chriſtian at his firſt oath of allegeance to God, is to abiure ſolemnly. They are the <hi>Diuell and his workes, the pompes and vanities of this wicked world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an expreſſe forme of abrenunciation of the Diuell and the pompes of the world is very ancient, and may well be thought to haue bin deriued from the Primitiue Church; whereof we find expreſſe mention in
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and others. Very well therefore hath it beene continued in the Church of God, and retained in this our Mother Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. True it is, that though ſuch diſauowing were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at Baptiſme, yet it muſt needes be included impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly in the very ſtipulation of that couenant, whereby we make our ſelues members of Chriſt: But it is a more liuely and firme monitory vnto vs, to hold vs in due alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to our Lord and Sauiour, when we record, that we haue at the firſt entring our names into his Band, and marching vnder his Banner, proclaimed an expreſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and abiuration of all his enemies. Whileſt this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> ſounds in our eares, how ſhall we dare to fly ouer like traytors to that enemie: nay, ſo much as to bee ſeene to maintaine correſpondence, or entertaine intelligence with thoſe that are profeſſed rebels againſt our Lord? I haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly before God and the congregation forſaken the Diuell and his workes, to cleaue vnto my Lord Chriſt, and to ſet my ſelfe about his holy worke. Shall I then put my hand, or heart to the workes of Sathan, of Darkeneſſe, of Death? Sure if I doe the Diuels worke, he will pay me my wages, the wofull wages of ſinne; what that is; if mine owne conſcience did not ſufficiently vpbraid me, the holy ſeruant of Chriſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth further tell me, <hi>The wages of ſinne is Death.</hi> I haue profeſſedly renounced the vanities and pompes of this wicked world. Shall I then turne ſeruant to <pb n="12" facs="tcp:767:22"/> ſo empty and deceiuing a Maſter, as is this wicked world? Sure if I doe, the reward of my ſinne will be in the end no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>anitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> Chriſt my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bought mee out of this wicked world: ſhall I ſell my ſelfe againe to that tyrant, and that for nothing? Such profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Meditations are ſuggeſted, by this couragious defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made in the firſt entrance into our Chriſtian warfare.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the ſubiect matter whereupon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming and forſaking is to be employed, it is a troupe of encompaſſing and beſieging enemies all too neere vs, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round about vs, and partly within vs. The Diuell, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible foe, moſt powerfull by his own ſubtilty and malice, he ſetteth vpon vs by ſuggeſtions to draw vs to his works. Verely none of them can be good, for hee can doe nothing but ſinne, and would make vs like himſelfe. He employeth theſe workes and workemen when hee breatheth into our ſoules the helliſh paſſions of preſumption, deſperation, pride, malice, murther of ſoules and bodies: contention of Religion, Atheiſme, Hereſie, &amp;c. For the influence of ſpirituall wickedneſſes, hee vſeth among all other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ſtrongeſt againſt our owne ſoules, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall purblind reaſon, to wound our Faith: he hence whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and kindleth his fiery darts. The world a more viſible foe, moſt inſnaring by entiſements and blandiſhments, that dazleth our eyes with the luſter of glittering pompes, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vanities. Our putting on gorgeous apparrell makes vs eaſily forget our putting on Chriſt, &amp; our loging to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with immortallity: ſumptuous buildings make vs too ſoone forget the houſe

As there are in all well-gouernd Chriſtian <pb n="13" facs="tcp:767:22"/> common-wealths, diſtinctions of habits, ornaments, and buildings, to put a difference betweene ſeuerall degrees of ſubiects, ſo much more is it fit that there ſhould be a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique ſplendor whereby the Prince and his Court may be conſpicuous aboue others. <hi>In domibus Regum ſunt, qui mollibus indumentis veſtiuntur.</hi> It is the brainſick humor of ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts to lay all the world leuell.

Our vow in Baptiſme renownceth not ciuil pompes befitting particular callings or occaſions, but the exceſſe of them, they being too much poſſeſſed by them, tranſported with them, or addicted to them. If they thus entice vs to forget God, and become a ſnare to vs, make vs to cling and cleaue to earthly things, then by our abuſe they dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into <hi>the vanities of this wicked world.</hi> Alas this they doe too often.

            <p>Anſw. <hi>Yes verily, and by Gods helpe, ſo J will. And I heartily thanke our heauenly father, that hath called mee to this ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, and I pray God to giue mee his grace, that I may continue in the ſame vnto my liues end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> This Anſwer is a manifold cord binding the baptiſed vnto theſe three duties. Firſt, an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obligation to performe in our owne perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer our Sureties haue vndertaken in our name. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble ſtrength of this bond is euident out of reaſon and common practiſe. The rule of Law is, <hi>Quod quis per alium facit, per ſe facere videtur.</hi> What a man doth by another, hee is in law taken to doe it by himſelfe. If I depute a man to <pb n="15" facs="tcp:767:23"/> ſeale a bond for mee, his act bindeth me as ſure, as if I had performed it immediately by my ſelfe. An oath taken by a Proctor <hi>in animam Domini,</hi> lyeth vpon the ſoule of him that authorized the taker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But an infant cannot make any deputation, nor can at all binde himſelfe, being not of iudgement and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo to doe, and therefore it ſeemes wee are free, from whatſoeuer was vndertaken by others for vs at our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> Whoſoeuer hath capacity of being baptized, muſt needs haue withall a ioynt ability to vndergoe the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Baptiſme, the duty doth inſeparably accompany the benefit. The ſtipulation of others for an Infant, where it is to his benefit, bindeth not onely in the gifts, but in the annexed duties. If a childe haue an hand to take a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall Leaſe, hee muſt alſo finde an hand to pay the rent and performe couenants. Nor doth the Obligation of obedience binde the baptized, meerely by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by the God-fathers: though there were no ſuch promiſe made by others for the childe, nor expreſsly by the party baptized (in caſe hee ſhould then bee of age) yet this holdeth <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> as an inſeparable condition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Sacrament of baptiſme: inaſmuch as all baptizing is <hi>into the ſimilitude of Chriſts death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> and implyeth on our part, the couenant of obedience, mortification, and dying vnto ſinne. Whoſoeuer therefore, whether man or childe hath ability to be baptized, muſt needes withall bee of capacity to vndergoe the couenants of Baptiſme. Doth Baptiſme conferre vpon thee the priuiledge of adoption to bee the childe of God? Semblably, it layeth vpon thee the yoake of obedience, to bee the dutifull ſeruant of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond duty is of proteſtation and reſolution to doe and performe in action what wee acknowledge due from vs vpon ſuch our Godfathers ſtipulation. Fitly therefore follow thoſe words <hi>By Gods helpe ſo I will.</hi> This bringeth the duties home to vs and faſtneth them not onely in our vnderſtanding; but in our wills and affections. Many <pb n="16" facs="tcp:767:24"/> are content to profeſſe this obligation, but the moſt are ſlow to achieue this reſolution.</p>
            <p>A third following duty is of Prayer, and that in both kinds: Firſt, thankeſgiuing to God for calling vs to this bleſſed eſtate; and then, petition for the grace of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Thankes to God is here firſt in order of nature; for who, conſidering himſelfe to bee made the childe of God, doth not at the firſt apprehenſion breake forth into the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Gods goodneſſe, and glorifying his bleſſed name for ſuch vnſpeakable mercy, before he dare preſume to begge a further guift from the ſame hand? Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> in moſt of his Epiſtles beginneth with commemoration of Gods fundamentall mercies in Chriſt, and thanks for them before hee proceed to new Petitions for continuance of ſauing graces. Thankſgiuing to God for grace, is the fruit of the firſt grace, and the ſeed of the latter.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, petition for Gods grace, for continuance in grace; ſheweth,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is not in our power to eſtabliſh our ſelues, but that wee muſt craue this bleſsing of him, who is the firſt Author and laſt finiſher of our faith, by whoſe power wee are kept and confirmed vnto Saluation, namely, the ſame power and mercy by which wee are firſt taken out of the iawes of hell, as I haue ſhewed before in handling the ability of forſaking the Diuell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the difference heerein appeareth, betweene the two eſtates of grace and glory, the imperfection of this life, and the abſolute Perfectneſſe of a better. Heere we are ſtill to intreat, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith:</hi> Lord ſtrengthen our hope: Lord aſsiſt our patience. But there wee ſhall not need to make requeſt for eſtabliſhment: our faith ſhall then bee euacuated, by accompliſhment; our hope fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by fruition; our patience needleſſe, where there ſhall bee no tribulation. There the exerciſe of the ſoule ſhall be in admiring, adoring, and magnifying that mercy and bounty, which hath preſerued vs to the end of our mortall liues, and hath crowned vs with life euerlaſting.</p>

Firſt, touching the name whereby they are called. What articles are, it is well knowne to euery man, and ſo is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, the Creed of the Apoſtles.

               <p>It is likely, and Hiſtory conſenteth heerein, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diſperſing themſelues ouer the world, according to their commiſsion to preach the Goſpell, aduiſedly compiled an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the ſame to remaine, as a rule, according to the analogy whereof, (though the Church were ſcattered farre and wide, yet both teachers and hearers might bee held <pb n="18" facs="tcp:767:25"/> in an holy agreement of the ſame faith: and hereſies ariſing, being brought heerevnto, as vnto a touchſtone, might bee tryed, and being found droſſe, reiected.

For mine owne part, hauing recited thus, what I finde touching the name, and firſt collection of theſe Articles, I will leaue euery man to iudge, as reaſon ſhall induce him to doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the number of Creedes. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that there haue beene many, ſome compiled by whole Councels, ſome by ſeuerall learned men of the Church, vpon ſpeciall occaſion, but none of thoſe, which haue beene made by the Orthodox, doe any whit differ in ſubſtance from this of the Apoſtles, they do onely ſet downe in more words, that which is here contained in fewer, and ſo may ſerue inſtead of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:767:25"/> ſome Commentaries vpon this of the Apoſtles. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall is the Nicene Creede, made ſome three hundred yeeres after Chriſts Incarnation, vnto which were conſenting 318, Fathers,
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great Emperor being Preſident. This (becauſe of
<hi>Arius,</hi> who denied Chriſts Diuinity) is larger in ſetting this forth, how hee is very God of very God, and of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father. Next is the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creede, made by that holy man
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was much perſecuted: but he made this as for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his owne ſincerity in the truth, ſo alſo to inſtruct and confirme others. And of like ſort is the
<hi>Epheſine,</hi> the <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the <hi>Agathen, &amp;c.</hi> So that we neede not be doubtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there be many, which to embrace; knowe, and receiue this, and ſo thou doſt know and receiue them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. The Creed pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, why. </note>Thirdly, concerning the ends, why this was committed to writing. They were ſundry and excellent. Firſt (as hath been already ſaide) to be a rule of Faith, and a preſeruatiue from Hereſie, 2 That it might bee a meane of diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true Chriſtians and heretiques, 3. That euery man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, might continually haue before his eyes that faith, for which he ſhould ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the defence whereof, hee ſhould ſtand vnto the death; 4. That euery one of the
<hi>Catechumeni</hi> (which were new conuerted Chriſtians) might haue in a readineſſe, what to anſwere in their baptiſme: when the Miniſter ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, what beleeueſt thou? or according to that of
<hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch: (<hi>If thou beleeueſt with all thine heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>thou maiſt bee baptized,</hi> vnto which he anſwered, <hi>I beleeue that Ieſus is the ſonne of God.</hi>) So when one of them was demaunded: Beleeueſt thou aright? he could, according to this forme of confeſſion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: <hi>I beleeue in God,</hi> &amp;c. And if theſe be the endes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe onely bee the right vſe of the Creede; then muſt it be acknowledged a groſſe abuſe amongſt ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to vſe it for a prayer; for the remoouing of which, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for ſignification of our readineſſe and conſtancy to defend the true Catholike Faith: it is rightly prouided in our Churches, that all ſhould ſtand, whilſt it is in rehearſing.<note place="margin">Standing at the Creeds rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> Some, I knowe, are offended hereat, and doe refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <pb n="20" facs="tcp:767:26"/> themſelues to this order, but truely they are too too diſorderly: for beſides, that hence there is a confuſion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in the Church, ſome ſtanding, ſome ſitting, and others kneeling, to the hindering the ignorant, from the knowledge of the right vſe, how doe they anſwer the reuerent behauiour of the firſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Auguſt: rom. <hi>10.</hi> p. <hi>327.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Explan.</hi> The articles of our faith, being a ſum of all things neceſſary to be knowne and beleeued vnto ſaluation (as hath beene already ſaid) comprehend therefore not onely things concerning God, but alſo the Church of God; ſo that they may be fitly conſidered in theſe two parts.

               <p>Firſt therefore touching the ſenſe of this Article. <hi>I beleeue,</hi> that is, I my ſelfe doe particularly know, and beleeue whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <pb n="27" facs="tcp:767:29"/> is here ſet down, and acknowledge it my duty ſo to doe, and not to reſt contented with a generall faith, beleeuing, as the Church beleeueth, without knowing the things beleeued: or with a generall faith beleeuing theſe things generally to be true, without applying them to my ſelfe.<note place="margin">

To proceed, <hi>I beleeue that God is my Father:</hi> that is, I doe not onely beleeue, that God is the Father of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nor that he is onely the Father of all things by creation, but that he is my Father by adoption and grace, and that I am his childe, though by nature I be the child of wrath: ſo that he is a Father by generation, by creation, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or adoption. My Father able to doe all things, that is all things, which it pleaſeth him, all things, that are arguments of infinite power, without excluſion of the Sonne, or holy Ghoſt, for the Sonne alſo is able to doe all things, and ſo is the holy Ghoſt, and thus I beleeue him to bee the creator of the world alſo, and the gouernour, for that this is aſcribed vnto the Father, as his proper worke, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of the Sonne, is the redemption of his people, and the proper worke of the holy Ghoſt their ſanctification, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being excluded from hauing to doe in the worke of creation, redemption, and ſanctification.

Thirdly, in regard of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tooles vſed, which were likewiſe none. Fourthly, in regard of the time, all things were finiſhed in ſix dayes, not that the Lord needed this time, for he could haue made all in an inſtant, but partly, that we might enter into a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and particular conſideration of all his glorious works, to ſet forth his praiſe: partly, that his prouident care ouer man might appeare, for that hee prepared all things fit for him before his creation, to ſtirre vp the greater care of his glory, in man: partly, to make knowne his ſoueraigne power ouer all creatures, when as hee cauſed light to bee without <pb n="29" facs="tcp:767:30"/> Sun, Moone, or Starres, &amp; trees, plants to growe without the influence of theſe heauenly bodies, ſhewing hereby, that howſoeuer he doth vſe meanes ordinarily, yet hee is not tyed hereunto, but can, and will, if it pleaſe him, worke all things without meanes, that wee might learne to relye vpon his helpe, when we are deſtitute of all meanes of comfort; and laſtly, to giue example of labouring in our callings the ſixe dayes, and ſanctifying a reſt vpon the ſeuenth.

But that both theſe be errours, that which is written of Chriſt doth plainely ſhew. Firſt, that the nature of man was taken to the God-head, and not aboliſhed by the Vnion. For, howſoeuer hee is ſaid to haue become fleſh, to haue beene made man; which may ſeeme to imply a conuerſion, or confuſion of ſubſtances; yet hee is elſe-where ſaide,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.

Secondly, ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and forgetfulnes of Gods great benefits: for the Lord had done wonderfully for man, prouiding all things ready <pb n="38" facs="tcp:767:35"/> for him before his creation, for neceſsity and delight, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a pleaſant place to inhabit, a Paradiſe, and power to eat all manner of fruit, of all ſorts of trees which hee planted not, only he gaue him a ſtraight charge concerning one tree onely, that he ſhould not eat thereof; for what day ſoeuer hee ſhould preſume to eat thereof he threatned death vnto him: yet vngratefull man forbeares not, but vpon the very firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhewes himſelfe diſloyall and goes beyond his limits. Thirdly, pride, and aſpiring vnto an higher eſtate, euen to be like his maker, yea to be equall vnto him, for the Deuill told them that they ſhould be as Gods. He was not content to be man, made after Gods image, and Lord and Ruler ouer all creatures in this world, beaſts, foules, &amp; fiſhes: but ſeeing the great Lord of all to be of greater dignity, he thought to ſit in the ſame chaire of ſtate with him. Fourthly, diſloyalty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to heare his maker blaſphemouſly diſcredited, as being enuious, and therfore forbidding him that tree, leſt by eating of it, he ſhould become as good as God himſelfe: yea, in his heart he conſented to this blaſphemy, thinking better of the curſed Deuill of hell, then of the God of Heauen, who is bleſſed for euer. So that heere was matter enough againſt him, for which to lade him with curſes, and to packe him out of Paradiſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Duty Mortification of ſinne. Heb. 6.6.</note>The ſecond duty is the mortification of our fleſhly members and ſinfull concupiſcences, and that for three ſpeciall cauſes: Firſt becauſe that by liuing ſtill in ſinne, we come to bee acceſſarie to this odious murdering, and killing of the Lord of all: for they that liue obſtinately in ſinne, <hi>do crucify againe the Son of God, and make a mocke of him,</hi> ſo farre are they from beleeuing in him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Their daily practiſe is to draw <hi>Chriſt</hi> vnto the croſſe, to driue nailes into his hands, and feete, to ſcoffe at him, and to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:767:44"/> runne him in with a ſpeeare to the very heart, howſoeuer in word they defie and ſpit at ſuch practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4. </note>Secondly, becauſe all ſuch, as vnto whom Chriſts death is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to doe away their ſinnes, are conformable vnto him in his death, and buriall. <hi>All that are baptiſed into Chriſt, haue put on Chriſt, and are by baptiſme buried with him into his death &amp;c.</hi> If the head be dead, and buried, the members cannot be aliue ſtill, no more can any true member of Chriſt, bee aliue vnto ſinne, ſuch as is euery true beleeuer: hee doth but prate then, and not beleeue that Chriſt was crucified, dead, buried, whoſoeuer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſtill willingly in any ſinne. Thirdly, becauſe no man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the trade of ſinne, can be Chriſts diſciple. For ſuch an one muſt deny himſelfe, that is, to be as hee is naturally and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the carriage of his owne diſpoſition, and ſo follow Chriſt. Hee muſt forſake all and goe after him, if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, father and mother brethren and ſiſters, houſe and ground, and life it ſelfe, that is, all profits, all pleaſures, and whatſoeuer moſt precious things might be an hinderance vnto him. As hee that would bee into any mans ſeruice entertained, muſt vtterly forſake his old ſeruice vnto his maiſters enemy, otherwiſe hee cannot belong vnto him: No more canſt thou belong vnto Chriſt, if thou be ſtill exerciſed in the workes of ſinne, his vtter enemy. Beſides beleeuing the ſufferings of Chriſt procures won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull loue of Chriſt, and where this loue is, there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all endeauour in all things to pleaſe him. If theſe things bee ſo, if the Son of man ſhould come now to iudgement, ſhould he finde faith vpon the earth, I feare hee ſhould finde but a very little, and but in very few.</p>

                  <note place="margin">3. Duty. Patience in ſuffering.</note>The third duty is patience and ioy in ſuffering any thing for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels, as thoſe which are glad of any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew their loue for ſo great loue of his. And wee are chiefly to reioyce heerein for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe that by ſuffering wee are made like vnto him, according to this his ſpeech,<note place="margin">Math. 15.25.</note> whereby hee incourageth his diſciples:
<hi>Jt is well for the Diſciple if he be as his Maiſter, and the ſeruant as his Lord,</hi> and wee ſhall be rewarded like vnto him afterward, for he ſaith, <hi>Reioyce &amp; be glad for great is your reward in heauen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 5.22.</note> We are to be like minded vnto
<hi>Vriah,</hi> who being bidden (when hee came weary from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:767:44"/> warres, to goe to his owne houſe, to cheare vp himſelfe, and to delight in the company of his wife) anſwered, nay,<note place="margin">2.

God forbid, I will be glad rather, if I bee counted worthy to ſuffer with him croſſes, perſecutions, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or death it ſelfe. Secondly, becauſe that in ſuffering for his truth, hee doeth grace vs, for ſo much as hee takes vs for his Martyrs, and witneſſes, as if the King ſhould chooſe certaine men out of his dominions to be his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, to maintaine his honour, furniſhing them in ſuch ſort, as that they could not bee ouercome, though they muſt ſtriue, and take great paines in playing their parts, yet they would doe it cheerefully, and ioy much herein, for that they would take it as an honor done vnto them by the King, more then vnto others: for euen thus doeth the Lord Ieſus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thoſe, whom he cals forth to ſuffer for his truth, they be his Champions, choſen to maintaine his honour, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides aſſuredly ſo for them, as that they ſhal ouercome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that glorying of <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <hi>In all things we are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that loued vs.</hi> And this was it, that made the Apoſtles glad for being beaten. <hi>They reioyced,</hi>

                  </note> and approaching of death vnto vs, becauſe our Lord Chriſt hath dyed, and in dying hath ouercome death, hee hath taken away the ſting of death, which before made it terrible: for the ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne, is the law, but for the one he hath ſatisfied by his death, the ſtrength of the other he hath made to ceaſe by the liberty, which hee hath brought vs, inſomuch as we are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace.

               <p>Now of all thoſe, that which ſtands for <hi>Limbo</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded; as by other ſound poſitiue reaſons drawne from Scriptures: ſo in regard alſo of the impertinency of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alleadged: for in that to the Hebrewes: <hi>The way into the holieſt was not yet opened,</hi> is meant nothing elſe but that, which in more words is there expreſſed,
<hi>viz.</hi> heauen and happineſſe, the redemption of man, as verſe 12. was not obtained by the ſeruice done in this tabernacle: and in the other, theſe dying <pb n="60" facs="tcp:767:46"/> receiued not the promiſes, is meant, the incarnation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſo long before, and ſo often promiſed, but not ſent in their times.</p>
               <p>The ſecond interpretation ſeemeth to mee too much ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and maketh this ſhort Creed needleſly to labour with tautologie, for what elſe can this import, He was buried, that is, laid in the graue, and deſcended into hell, that is, went downe into the graue, as if it had beene ſaid, He was buried, and was buried.</p>
               <p>The third not much different from this, and onely ſheweth that this his buriall was not a meere tranſeunt act or paſsion but had a due continuation by his body ſo remaining, <hi>in ſtatis quo,</hi> till his reſurrection, which me thinkes is ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the ſpecifying of his buriall and riſing the third day, importing that for that
<hi>interim</hi> his body lay ſtill in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</p>
               <p>The fourth interpretation hath farre more probability, this Creed being compoſed by thoſe, who fitted it not onely to the Greeke ſtile, (in which language it was written) but alſo to the Hebrew ordinary phraſe, which ſoundeth in this faſhion, ſpeaking of a dead man, namely, that he is dead and gone downe into <hi>Sheol,</hi> which whether you tranſlate, hell or the graue, or ſome place of bliſſe, it doth not heereby ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any of theſe diſtinctly, but onely pointeth at the ſtate and condition of the dead in generall, and conſidereth them by a confuſed motion, as oppoſite to the ſtate of the liuing heere vpon earth. So that by this conſtruction, heere is to bee meant, that our Sauiours, not body onely, but ſoule alſo did for this meane ſpace vndergoe the common lot of ſeparation the one from the other, and ſo remained in the ordinary eſtate of others departed this life. Howſoeuer it bee yeelded that this phraſe may well beare this ſenſe; yet becauſe both thus much is implied in the generall word of Chriſts being dead, (which muſt needs meane a true death, putting him in the common condition of other deadmen) and foraſmuch as theſe words of deſcent, &amp;c. doe rather import ſomewhat added to his death and buriall, the more currant expoſition is to make it a ſeuerall and different Article or Parcell of our Sauiours <pb n="61" facs="tcp:767:46"/> performances: and ſo wee will now conſider in the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning interpretations.</p>
               <p>That branch of the firſt interpretation, auouching that our Sauiour did ſometime <hi>in triduo mortis,</hi> really deſcend in ſoule into the place of the damned, is moſt literall, naturall, and agreeable to the words, no way lyable to tautologie, nor repugnant to the analogie of Faith; but conſorting with the plaine termes of Scripture and teſtimony of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Though ſome be of another minde in this point, yet I ſee no coactiue reaſons out of Scripture, or otherwiſe brought by them againſt this plaine literall conſtruction.

               <p>Firſt, if hee had not ſuffered extreame torments in ſoule, (beſides what he ſuffered by ſympathy, through bodily pangs) hee muſt either haue been weake, and ouer-yeelding, or elſe haue diſſembled, being without ſorrow,<note place="margin">Sixt. Sennenſi Bibl. Patrum. li.

For before his paſsion vpon the croſſe, he was very heauy, &amp; much troubled,<note place="margin">Math. 26.38. verſe 39.40</note> in ſo much as hee ſaid, <hi>My ſoule is very heauy euen vnto the death,</hi> and prayed three times, if it were poſsible; <hi>that the cup might paſſe from him:</hi> at what time alſo his paſsion was noted to be ſo great, that he ſweat with paine, <hi>and his ſweat was like drops of bloud,</hi>

O then, if I doe thus, if I rot in the dregges of my ſinnes, how ſhall I indure his anger? how regardleſſe will hee bee of mee when I ſhall in my need cry for mercy?

Wherefore, as a <pb n="64" facs="tcp:767:48"/> poore priſoner in for ſome capitall crime, but againe relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his life, and onely chaſtized with ſome few ſtripes, will reioyce in the middeſt of theſe his petty ſufferings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what hee hath eſcaped: So wee, being in miſery in this world, but deliuered from the euerlaſting torments due vnto vs for our offences, cannot but reioyce in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt heereof, ſeeing wee haue eſcaped that miſery, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times greater.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſincerely confeſſe that though theſe reaſons and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues bee yeelded vnto, as prouing the truth of this doctrine; namely, that Chriſt did thus ſuffer in ſoule; yet they inforce not, that this muſt be the ſenſe of this Article. There are many true poſitions in Diuinity concerning the actions and paſsions of our ſauiour, which are not euident Articles of faith, nor directly intended by any parcell of the Creed.

               <p>For the duties ariſing from this Faith; they are two: Firſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Duty.</hi> To liue, as at peace with God. Rom. 4. &amp; Chap. 5.1. Epheſ. 2</note> to liue as thoſe, that be at peace with God; For, as he dyed for our ſinnes, ſo hee roſe againe for our Iuſtification, and being <hi>iuſtified by faith, we haue peace with God:</hi> before, wee were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſo much at varience, as that we are ſaid, to haue beene without God in the world; but now, this difference is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and we are throughly reconciled. Now, that we may liue as ſuch, we muſt practice theſe foure things. Firſt, contentation,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.2</note> and ioy in tribulation, as is added in the ſame place, not onely haue we peace with God, but reioyce in tribulation: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, that <hi>He gaue his cheeke to the nippers,</hi>

Fourthly, becauſe God hath his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Peace, the Miniſters of Gods Word amongſt vs, we muſt vſe them reuerently, and redily hearken to all good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they ſhall make vnto vs on Gods part: leſt the Lord, ſeeing our baſe vſage of them, and our regardleſneſſe of ſuch wholeſome inſtructions, as they offer vnto vs in his name, grow angry, and refuſe to keepe any more peace with vs. We muſt therefore take into our mouthes,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14</note> that of the Prophet, <hi>How beautifull are the feet of thoſe, that bring glad tydings of peace, and glad tidings of good things.</hi> We muſt yeelde thoſe, that labour in the World <hi>double honour,</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Duty.</hi> To riſe vp to newneſſe of life. Rom. 6.4</note>The ſecond duty ariſing hence, is to riſe vp to a holy and new life from the death of ſinne, as Chriſt our Lord aroſe from death to life: <hi>Like as Chriſt was raiſed vp from the dead, to the glory of the Father, ſo ſhould we alſo walke in newneſſe of life;</hi> yea, we muſt doe this if we would not haue the ſecond death, to rule ouer vs, according to that diuine voyce.<note place="margin">Reuel.
20.6</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed, and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, for ouer ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,</hi> Now, as our firſt life, <hi>viz.</hi> our naturall, hath certaine ſignes, as breath, warmth, motion, &amp;c whereby it is knowne: ſo hath this ſecond, our ſpirituall life, and theſe ſignes are chiefly foure.

                  <note place="margin">Signes of a new life. Col 3.1</note>
                  <hi>where Chriſt Ieſus ſits at the right hand of God, &amp;c.</hi> For if the minde be ſtill plodding vpon the earth, and earthly things, if the thoughts be altogether bent this way, how is there any riſing, if the foode that periſheth be ſtill moſt ſought after, how is there another kinde of life, the meanes of ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it being neglected; wherefore Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> willeth ſuch, as be riſen to a new life,<note place="margin">1 Peter 2.2</note> 
                  <hi>As new borne Babes, to deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that they may growe thereby.</hi> Secondly, an holy and innocent life: for ſuch onely are riſen with Chriſt, as haue put on Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph.
4.14</note> as haue put on the new man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. They which are ſtill the old men they were, if they were vnholy, vnholy ſtill, if vile, vile
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:767:52"/> ſtill; they, I ſay, are not riſen to a new life, they are not ranged into the order of true Chriſtians, our captaine Chriſt hath put all his Souldiers into an other faſhion. <hi>They are blameleſſe, and pure,</hi>

                  <hi>and the Sonnes of God in the middeſt of a naughty and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nation without rebuke.</hi> Thirdly, greater ioy in the grace of God through Ieſus Chriſt, then in any thing, either of pleaſure, or profit, in this world, becauſe worldly things are olde, ioy in them is paſt, now we are come to liue a new life, as hee which is preferred from a poore Farmer, to be Lord of great poſſeſsions: he is now a new man, he ioyes not in his Farme which he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others, it delights him not, that he had ſuch a poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eſtate, but in this his new aduancement is his comfort. So we (being riſen from an old life to a new, from a naturall to a ſpirituall with Chriſt, from the life of the Children of wrath, and of ſinnes ſeruants to the life of the Sonnes of God,) cannot but ioy onely in this, in regard of exceeding ioy, and we cannot but accompt all things droſſe and dung, with the Apoſtle, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the excellent knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8</note> and of him crucified, and riſen againe. Wee cannot but compt it meat and drinke vnto vs with our bleſſed Sauiour,<note place="margin">Iohn 4.34</note> when we are thus doing the will of our Father, <hi>viz.</hi> in workes of holineſſe. Fourthly, growth, and increaſe in ſanctification; for nothing which begins to liue and is like to come to perfection, and to continue, is without growth; no more is any man, which begins to liue a new life in holineſſe, he is not forward herein to day, and backeward to morrow, a babe for knowledge, and practice this yeare, and a babe an whole yeere, or ſeuen yeares hence: but he goeth forward, &amp; groweth in grace,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3 18 Iohn 15.1</note> and in the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth vs to doe. He is a branch of the Vine Chriſt, which ſhooteth much foorth in a ſhort time,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1, 1.2</note> he is a tree planted by the waters ſide, and not ſome ſhrub com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp vpon the drie heath. If theſe things be ſo, what a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Faith is there in moſt men? when there be onely words to expreſſe it, <hi>That Chriſt our head roſe againe the third day, &amp;c.</hi> but it is plainely diſproued in deedes, by want of this newneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>And hitherto of the firſt branch of this Article, now follows the other. <hi>He aſcended vp into heauen,</hi> For the meaning. Hee being reuiued from the dead (his ſoule comming againe into his body) walked heere a while vpon earth for the ſpace of forty <pb n="74" facs="tcp:767:53"/> daies, eating and drinking ſometimes with his Diſciples, not for any neede of ſuſtenance, but for more aſſurance of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and offering his body to be felt, and handled, comforting and inſtructing them, and then in the open ſight of them all, he went vp body and ſoule into the heauens, they looking and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 5.24</note> the ſeuenth from <hi>Adam;</hi> who is ſaid to haue walked with God, and to haue beene taken away from amongſt men: and in <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, who, whileſt he was walking, and talking with

Laſtly Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſetteth downe,<note place="margin">Acts

                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.10</note> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee is aſcended farre aboue all heauens, viz.</hi> all viſible heauens to the higheſt, where the throne of God is, yea, <hi>Steuen</hi> the firſt Martyr addeth, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Acts 7.56</note> I <hi>ſee the heauens open, and the Sonne of Man ſtanding at the right hand of God:</hi> and hee did once more yet manifeſt himſelfe to <hi>Saul</hi> a perſecutor to be there, when hee called from heauen vnto him,<note place="margin">Acts 9.4</note> ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:767:53"/> which indeed did wonderfully confirme this thing, euen to vnbeleeuers, for that ſo forward a perſecutor was ſuddenly heerevpon turned to be a moſt zealous Preacher, for that hee which hated Chriſt, did ſet forth Chriſt his reſurrection, and aſcenſion vp into heauen, in euery place where he came. And wee are chiefly to gather all teſtimonies about this matter, becauſe that ſeducers and coozeners (who would make the world beleeue that themſelues were ſome great perſons, when they haue done many and great matters, haue altogether fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this laſt act of riſing from the dead, and going vp to heauen, peculiar indeed to the Sonne of God alone. Such was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> a Coniurer, who by his inchauntments much hindred the Goſpell, and aduanced himſelfe, and made the world beleeue, that after his beheading, hee made himſelfe aliue againe: but when hee by his impoſtures, made a proffer to aſcend to heauen alſo in the ſight of many, hee fell downe againe, and breaking his necke, miſerably ended his dayes. Such alſo was <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great Prophet of the Turkes. Hee commanded that his body ſhould be kept from buriall vntill the third day after his death, promiſing that he would then reuiue againe; but it being kept not onely to the third, but to the thirtieth, euen till a moſt horrible ſtinch came from him, no ſuch thing appeared, onely they put his body in an Iron coffer, which hangeth vpon the top of his Temple by the vertue of Loadſtones, to the deceiuing of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people to this day.

And this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainly: firſt, for that many of the viſible Church are reprobates, and without part in Gods Kingdome, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt teacheth by many parables, both of the ſower that went forth to ſowe, ſome of his ſeede falling vpon the thorny ground,<note place="margin">Math. 13</note> ſome vpon ſtony, and ſome vpon the high way, and ſo bringing forth no fruit: and in the parable of the drawnet,<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> of the good corne, and the tares, of the Virgins, of the ſeruants with their talents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which tend to ſet forth the ſtate of Gods Church to be ſuch, as that therein there be many caſtawayes.

<hi>Jeron part: S. Epiſt:</hi> 41. <hi>Non dicimus credo in, ſed credo eccleſiam.</hi>
                  </note> that the Church is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be beleeued, thas is, acknowledged, where it is found to be, and to be cleued vnto: but not to be beleeued in, that is, to be made the foundation of our faith. This point, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of ſeuerall members, ſo are they diſtinctly, and ſeueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be laid open. Firſt it is to be acknowledged, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is found out by the markes before ſpoken of; thus the Church at Rome, was once famous all ouer the world; and <hi>Peter</hi> indeauoured much, after that he had once beene with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the Gentiles;<note place="margin">Rom. 1 8 Act 12.5.6</note> to bring the Church of the Iewes to acknowledge them to bee the Church of God alſo: and indeed, how otherwiſe can I ſay, <hi>I beleeue the Church?</hi> Which is firmely to hold, and conſtantly to acknowledge it. Secondly, it is alſo to be cleaued vnto; for when the Church began firſt to flouriſh vnder the Goſpell, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 2</note> that <hi>God added vnto the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaued,</hi> he prouided that they ſhould be ioyned vnto the aſſemblies of his people, ſo that as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaide vnto the Lord, <hi>whether ſhould we goe? thou haſt the wordes of eternall life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.68</note> ſo ſaith euery faithfull man and woman of his ſpouſe the Church. Eternall life is no where elſe to be obtained, all the creatures out of the Arke periſhed, ſo doe all that keepe out of the Church. The word preached therefore, is by all to be attended, the Sacraments <pb n="108" facs="tcp:767:70"/> are reuerently to be receiued, the aſſemblies of Gods people to be frequented.<note place="margin">Cantic.

<hi>Get thee forth by the ſteppes of the flockes, and feede their Kids by the tents of the ſhepheards.</hi> Thirdly, it is not to bee made the foundation of our faith, becauſe ſo the ſpouſe ſhould be ſet in the roome of the husband Chriſt, and becauſe that ſo we might erre, and fall from true Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as any viſible Church may doe, and many haue done. For the firſt, it was before ſhewed, that there can be none other foundation: for the next it is manifeſt, that the Church of the Iewes did often times erre, and chiefly in crucifying the Lords <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> The Church of Galatia did erre ſo farre, that the Apoſtle profeſſeth himſelfe to bee afraid that hee had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vaine amongſt them: hee was afraide alſo of the Church of Rome for the ſame errour, which maketh him ſo long in prouing iuſtification by faith without the workes of the Law.<note place="margin">Reuel. 3.3.</note> The Church of Sardis was ſo farre gone, that the Lord ſaith, it had onely a name to be aliue, but was indeede dead, and the Church of Laodicea was ſpiritually miſerable, poore, blind and naked: and eccleſiaſticall hiſtory doth ſhew, that ſcarce any Church hath beene free, but at ſometime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with hereſie, which though it was not in former times noted in the Church of Rome; yet I take it, it could not be farre from hereſie,<note place="margin">Jerom: Damaſus.</note> when the head thereof <hi>Liberius</hi> ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto Arianiſme and

                  </note> and more lately, in the Councell of Trent order is taken, that the ſame Nicene decree, bee of all men followed.

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:767:71"/>But theſe contradictions already obſerued may ſuffice, to ſhew, that the Roman Church it ſelfe is not free, but ſubiect to errour and hereſie, for contradictories cannot bee both truthes, therefore it muſt needes ſometime onely haue beene in the truth, and ſometime againe carried away with hereſie. Laſtly, this further appeareth, from the conſideration of the manner, how things haue beene carried from time to time, in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometime according to the will of one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, King, or Pope, and ſometime of ſome few, and that not ſincerely, but apparantly ſeeking themſelues, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſatisfie their malicious mindes. I ſhould dwell too long here, if I ſhould enter into a particular exemplification of this: it is ſo plaine to all that read of their proceedings, as that it cannot be denied. Firſt, ſomething hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by an higher power, then a Councell called, and his minde being divulged, they feare to appeare, that be of a contrary opinion, or if they appeare, they are not admitted into the Councell, or through feare recanting, are receiued; &amp; ſo it is proceeded to the matter propounded. Then a great ſhewe is made, of calling vpon the Spirit of truth, for his aſſiſtance, but all is concluded, according as was before conceiued: and accordingly is taught in the Churches; and thus the people of God, vnder the pretext of Councels, is ſeduced. Which things being ſo, let the Reader iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church viſible may not eaſily erre: ſeeing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, from whence things there held doe proceed, is thus troubled and filthy. Againe, admit that freer councels, which repreſent the Church, bee called (which cannot be granted to haue beene in the Roman Church, certaine hundreds of yeeres laſt paſt) yet who be they that make vp councels? are they not men: that I may not ſay, men altogether intangled with voluptuous liuing, aſpiring after nothing but honours &amp; filthy lucre for the moſt part? &amp; what aſſurance, I pray you can we then haue that they cannot er? yea, what feare may we not iuſtly haue, that they haue altogether erred?

That the inuiſible Church <pb n="119" facs="tcp:767:75"/> of God, <hi>viz</hi> all true beleeuers, are accepted for holy in Chriſt Ieſus, at the very firſt act of their conuerſion vnto the true faith, though before they were moſt vncleane by ſin. 2.

<hi>viz.</hi> with a conſtant hatred, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt all ſinne, and with the loue of vertue and grace, and with an earneſt ſtudy and care to grow herein. 3.

That euery true viſible Church is holy alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of the beſt members thereof, though not in regard of the moſt, or greateſt therein. 5 That howſoeuer the corruption of manners aboundeth, yet the doctrine remaineth holy, and pure, reprouing theſe corruptions, and vrging to all holines of conuerſation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Expla.</hi> After the deſcription of the true Church of God by the markes, here followeth the comfortable, and bleſſed eſtate thereof ſet downe in theſe Priuiledges: <hi>The Communion of Saints &amp;c.</hi> that no man may thinke it loſt labour, either to ſeeke out the true Church, or to endeauour to ioyne himſelfe vnto the ſame. For the meaning of this firſt priuiledge: <hi>The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints</hi> is as much in effect, as their common vnion vnto Chriſt their head, and through him vnto God the Father, and of one vnto another, euen as there is an vnion betwixt members <pb n="140" facs="tcp:767:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the ſame body, which vnion ſtretcheth not onely to the Church militant, howſoeuer diſpearſed, but euen to the Church triumphant alſo, and the Saints in heauen. So that firſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the communion of Saints. I doe hold, and acknowledge that none in the world of what company or degree ſoeuer, are ſo highly aduanced, and ſo happy for the fellowſhippe, into the order of which they are ioyned, as the Saints are, as they which are of the company of Gods Church and people; Becauſe that they may happily bee ioyned to men famous vpon earth, but theſe are ioyned to the holy ones placed in heauen; they may be ioyned to Princes, and men great vpon earth, but theſe are ioyned to the King of Kings, to the greateſt both in earth, and in heauen. Secondly, the communion of Saints is as much, as their communicating with their head Ieſus Chriſt, and with one another, whereby Chriſts merits and righteouſneſſe are made common vnto them, and their ſinnes and miſeries vnto him: and their prayers, faſtings, and deuotions are made common vnto one another, not only amongſt the liuing, but euen amongſt the liuing, and the Saints departed alſo; and laſtly, whereby tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and outward things of this life are made common vnto them, through Chriſt, who is heire of all things, ſo as that they only haue true right, and title before God vnto earthly things. I doe then in the ſecond place here acknowledge, and beleeue that no ſmall good comes of this communion, but ſuch as the world cannot afford; for my ſins are laid vpon Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe ſerueth to cloath me, if I be in miſery, hee is not without ſenſe and feeling thereof, but what is done againſt mee, he accounts it, as done againſt himſelfe: Moreouer the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and daily prayers of all good people aſcend vp for me, if I be afflicted they grieue, if in welfare they ioy, yea, the Saints in heauen cry to God for the ſhortening of our daies of miſery: Laſtly, though mine eſtate bee neuer ſo poore in this world, yet I am richer then many, that haue great poſſeſsions, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vſurpers, but I hauing right vnto my poore cloathes, and ſlender diet, &amp; vnto more, as God ſhall be pleaſed to ſend it me: and if I be rich, I communicate vnto the neceſsities of Gods children, and thus prouide me riches, that ſhall neuer periſh, or be loſt.</p>

The Iudiciall is ſo called, becauſe as a ſtatute-law, it ſetteth down with what iudgements and cenſures men were to be cenſured, that did offend in ſpeciall caſes. The Ceremoniall is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is altogether conuerſant about rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſhewing what ceremonies were to be vſed by the church of God, and what not in his ſeruice.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 1.12. 1. Sam: 15.22 </note>Now, the difference betwixt theſe, ſtandeth in many things. Firſt, in that the morral Law was publiſhed, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God himſelfe, ſo as that all the people did receiue it from his mouth: but it was not ſo with the Iudiciall and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall; for the Lord inſtructed <hi>Moſes</hi> onely herein, and the people receiued them from him, who wrote them downe for them.
2. The Morrall Law was firſt giuen, as moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the other two afterwards, as not ſo much to be regarded, in reſpect of it: for when the Morall Law hath beene negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the other moſt diligently obſerued, the Lord hath beene as much moued, as if no Law at all had beene regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which may eaſily be gathered, both from that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſay;
<hi>Bring no more oblations in vaine, incenſe is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto me, &amp;c.</hi> And from that of <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul, Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? behold, to obey is better then ſacrifice, and to harken, then the fat of rams:</hi> that is, to obey the Morall Law, farre exceedeth all ceremonies.

                  </note> who in his Inſtitutions doth very ſoundly determine this point, ſhewing that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, nor expedient, that the Lawes of other Nations ſhould be the ſame that were preſcribed vnto the Iewes in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of crimes, euen againſt the expreſſe Morall Law, Theft, Adultery, &amp;c. But referring the agrauation, or mitigation of ſuch penalties to the nature and propenſitie of particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to the neceſſities of diuers times and occaſions. To the Iewes (ſaith he) God was <hi>peculiaris legiſlator;</hi> and, as a wiſe Law-maker, ordained thoſe Lawes with a ſingular reſpect to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

What Law of the Iudicialls of the Iewes; nay, what Ciuill Law almoſt at all in any orderly Common-wealth throughout the world, tendeth not to the maintaining ſome Morall Law, and forwarding ſome duty concerning the liues, goods, chaſtitie, good name, peace, and iuſtice of, and among our neighbors? muſt therefore the Lawes (I meane the iuſt and honeſt lawes) of all other Nations bind vs? muſt the ſame penalties in euer ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offence be currant through the world? Surely I know no Law for that. Generall equitie is diuerſified by particular, and not onely due puniſhments, but alſo offences are truly greater and leſſer in varietie of times, places and people, eſpecially in thoſe actions, which conſerue the more remote parts and skirts of the Morall Law. What ſhall wee ſay then? ate we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans no more in dutie tied to the Iudicials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then to the Poſitiue Lawes of the Perſians, Lacedemonians, or the Romans, made for the puniſhment of vice, and vpholding of common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie? I dare not in any wiſe ſay, or thinke ſo. Theſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed by the light of Nature only, thoſe ſuggeſted by immediate reuelation from God, and therefore incomparably exceeding for eminent wiſdome and iuſtice. Nay, moreouer, the Iudicials, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue not in themſelues any obligatory power, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall force to bind other Eſtates and Kingdomes; yet in regard of the generall equitie implied in them, they remaine as a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and conſcionable direction vnto Law-makers now adayes in Chriſtian Common-wealths, where the nature of the people, and ſtrong motiues from experience doth not enforce another way. This exemplary direction, though it be leſſe to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thoſe prouiſions, which are moſt circumſtantiall and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as being farre off a kind to the Morall Law; yet me thinks, in the more eſſentiall and fundamentall parts of the perpetuall <pb n="181" facs="tcp:767:107"/> and vniuerſall Morall Law, the diſcreet imitation of Gods poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Lawes is very requiſite, It pertaineth not to vs priuate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to preſcribe, but onely to wiſh and mention with humilitie, what we conceiue out of a good conſcience. For my part, in my poore vnderſtanding, it many times grieueth me to thinke, how in our dayes the foule adulterer vſually eſcapeth in a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and the pilfering cut-purſe is truſſed vp on the curſed tree without redemption: whereas Gods poſitiue Moſaicall law ſtrake farre deeper in the former, and in the later more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, prouiding alſo in this a meanes of reliefe to the party wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by accumulated reſtitution. If any man be ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as in this heinous crime of violating wedlocke, to take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the new Teſtament, and to claime thence impunity for this impuritie.

               <p n="1">1. In the manifeſtation, the Law is knowne by the light of Nature, as hath been alreadie ſhewed, euen before that it was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely giuen: but the Goſpell is a myſtery vnto Nature, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, ſaying; <hi>Without all controuerſie,</hi>

                  </gap>, the word ſignifieth, prying into a thing ouer-veyled and hidden from ſight. It was firſt reuealed by God himſelfe, after publiſhed by Angels, by Men, by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by Deuils, and by dumb Idols.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law doth onely ſhew what is to bee done, that God
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:767:108"/> may be pleaſed, but here leaueth vs, without inſtruction how to do it, becauſe that way, which it ſetteth downe is to vs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible: but the Goſpell doth fully informe vs, how this may be done, namely by Ieſus Chriſt who hath fulfilled all for vs, and is made vnto vs belieuing in him, <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth: and ſo the one may rightly be termed, the Law of Faith, the other of workes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law is full of terrible threatnings, and without comfort in the promiſes thereof, becauſe nothing is promiſed, but vpon too hard conditions, <hi>Doe this, and thou ſhalt liue;</hi> it doth therefore only caſt downe, and wound with the wounds of deadly ſinne;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.

The law is therefore the <hi>letter that killeth, the Goſpell is the ſpirit that giueth life.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.6. Gal. 3.24. </note>Laſtly, the Law is a Schoolemaſter <hi>to bring vs vnto Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith; for as without a Schoolemaſter firſt had, and vſed for entrance in rudiments, children come not to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, ſo without the law we cannot be ſufficiently taught to be preferred vnto Chriſt, becauſe we reſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented through ignorance in ſin, wounded to the death, and yet not knowing, that we need to ſeek a remedy: but the Goſpell admitteth vs vnto Chriſt, and incorporateth vs into his body, it opneth the gate vnto vs, and giueth vs entrance into his moſt ſtately pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of heauen. The Law is alſo a Schoolemaſter, when we are come to Chriſt, euer checking and correcting vs, when wee walke not according to the ſtraight rule thereof: but the Goſpel vpon our humiliation comforteth vs, and aſſureth vs, that al our aberrations, and going aſtray are remitted, ſo that there be an heart vnfainedly hating that euill which we doe.</p>

In the author, God; not, as the mad Manichees taught the bad God to be the author of the law, and the good God, the <pb n="183" facs="tcp:767:108"/> author of the Goſpell: for the ſame God, which ſpake by his Son Ieſus Chriſt in theſe laſt daies, ſpake alſo at diuers times, and in diuers maners in times paſt: he that ſaid from heauen, <hi>this is my beloued Son, heare ye him,</hi> the ſame God ſpake all theſe words, &amp; ſaid from heauen, <hi>I am thy Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They agree in the threatning of ſin, and vrging obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Lord in all things: but the Law vrgeth it for feare, the Goſpel for loue, <hi>If ye loue me keepe my Commandements,</hi> the Law as the meritorious cauſe of life, the Goſpell, as moſt neceſſary ſignes of the life of faith, and the way that God hath appointed vs to walke in vnto life, the Law giueth no hope in the caſe of ſwaruing from the ſtrict rule thereof, the Goſpell giueth hope to the penitent, and where the like hope is giuen by the Prophets, they doe rather play Euangeliſts, then Preachers of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They agree in this, that howſoeuer the Goſpell giueth hope to the penitent, yet it denieth all hope to thoſe that liue, and die in tranſgreſsion of the Law, for againſt ſuch moſt common are the threatnings contained in the Goſpell, <hi>They that doe ſuch things,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They agree in this, that there is no contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, but as they come from one, and the ſame ſpirit, ſo there is a ſweet harmony &amp; conſent between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, what God doth ſtrictly require in his iuſtice, the other, how his iuſtice is ſatisfied, and yet his mercy to ſinfull man appeareth; the one ſaith,
<hi>he that breaketh the Commandements ſhall die;</hi> the other ſaith, that becauſe man through the weaknes of his nature could not but breake them, one man, that neuer brake any the leaſt of them, died in the ſtead of ſinfull man, and thus freed him, that was the ſon of death, from death and damnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They agree in the Miniſters of them both: for they of the Law were to be without blemiſh, their lipps were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue knowledge, they were to liue of their ſeruice, they were diuers ſorts, both Prieſts &amp; Leuits, they were watchmen, &amp;c. ſo ought the miniſters of the Goſpell, they muſt be vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <pb n="184" facs="tcp:767:109"/> apt to teach, they that preach the Goſpell, are to liue of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="1">1. Firſt, there was great preparation, three dayes together, the people were ſanctified according to the manner of thoſe times, by waſhings and purifyings, ſhewing, both what need wee haue by prayer, and reading of the holy Scriptures (which may bring vs from worldly to heauenly meditations) to prepare our ſelues euer, before that we come to heare the Lord ſpeaking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the Miniſtery of his holy word: and alſo, how wee muſt euer be more and more doing away, by the Spirit of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the blots and blemiſhes of our natures, that we may be the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come into the preſence of the Holyeſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, a ſtraight charge was giuen, that neither man nor beaſt, vnder paine of death, ſhould come neere the Mount, whence the Law was to be deliuered, but certaine marks were ſet beyond which none might dare to paſſe: ſhewing, as the Apoſtle hence noteth,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.6.7. Heb. 12.19.</note> how glorious was the Law, now to bee deliuered, and, if ſuch as paſſed the markes ſet them, were without mercy to die the death, that much more the tranſgreſſours of any of theſe precepts ſhould die, and find no mercy.</p>

<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe to haue ſaid, <hi>I tremble and quake:</hi> ſhewing, that the things here vttered, were graue and waightie, and to be receiued into the heart, with a feare of offending againſt them: and alſo, that when the time ſhall bee, of calling the offenders to account, with what wonderfull terrour the Lord will then come againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Almighty God himſelf ſpake al theſe words in the hearing of al the people; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were too weak to beare his words, and deſired that the Lord would not ſpeake any more (for ſo

               <p n="5">5. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had broken theſe Tables through zeale (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how God was diſhonoured in his abſence; by golden Calues, which they had ſet vp, and worſhipped) the Lord bad him hew two other Tables, and therein he wrote all the words that were in the firſt: ſhewing hereby, that mans heart by Gods creation, had all the lawes ready written in it, as the Tables prepared by God himſelfe had, but the heart, which he had gotten vnto himſelfe by falling away from God, is without any letter hereof in effect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that the Lord wrote them anew, as it was with the Tables pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by <hi>Moſes.</hi>

For ſome haue placed fiue in either Table, as the Iewes, <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> learned Writers amongſt them: Some haue placed three in the firſt Table, and ſeuen in the ſecond, as ſometime <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did, to expreſſe the myſterie of the Trinitie: but the Papiſts doe it at this day, to defend their Idolatry, and yet to keepe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ten, they deuide the laſt Commandement into two; and ſo doe the Lutherans. Some againe diuide them by foure in the firſt Table, and ſixe in the latter, as almoſt all ancient Greeke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Athanatius, Origen, Gregorius, Nazianzenus, Chryſoſtomus,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome Latines, as elſewhere,
<hi>Auguſtine, Hierom, Ambroſe, Sulpitius,</hi> &amp;c. But this controuerſie might ſoone be ended, if men would bring their religion to Gods Law, and not Gods Law to their religion, as they of the Roman Church doe. For if the firſt table bee the firſt and greateſt Commandement of the Law, teaching vs to loue the Lord with all our heart; and the ſecond be like vnto it, teaching our duty towards our neighbour, how we ſhould loue him, as our ſelues, as Chriſt himſelfe hath taught, then it is without doubt, that all which teach the loue of God, belong to the firſt; and all which teach our duty towards our neighbour, belong to the ſecond Table. Which being ſo, and foure diſtinct things giuen in charge, touching the loue of God; and ſix touching our neighbour, and no more, how can the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction fitly be otherwiſe made, but into foure and ſix?

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</note>The ſecond rule is this; Euery negatiue commandement doth bind alwaies, and vnto all times: euery affirmatiue doth onely bind alwaies, but not vnto all times alſo, as for example: <hi>Thou ſhalt not haue no other Gods but me:</hi> the affirmatiue of hauing the Lord for our God doth bind alwaies, ſo that he ſinneth; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer at any time denieth the Lord in his heart, or doth contrarie to the feare or loue of God: but hee ſinneth not, that doth not actually exerciſe theſe affections at all times, becauſe that a man ſometime ſleepeth, ſometime through the violence of diſeaſes looſeth the vſe of his reaſonable ſoule, many times alſo is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with vehement thoughts which employ the mind another way; and laſtly, occaſions are not at all times offered to try our hearts. The fourth Commandement in the affirmatiue hath, <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day:</hi> againſt this hee ſinneth, whoſoeuer doth breake the Sabbath: but he ſinneth not, that doth not keepe it at all times, and parcels of times, becauſe the weakeneſſe of our natures requireth ſome reſt and pauſe, at what time we cannot be buſied in holy exerciſes. The like is to bee ſaid of honouring our parents &amp;c. But come to negatiue Commandements, and you ſhall ſee, that whoſoeuer ceaſeth from obſeruing them at any time, is a ſinner; for example; <hi>Thou <pb n="193" facs="tcp:767:113"/> ſhalt doe no murther,</hi> is a negatiue command: and ſo is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery:</hi> if any man then ſhall murther at any time, or be adulterous, whether he be drunken or ſober, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or quiet, tempted or not, in whatſoeuer place, time or occaſion, hee is a tranſgreſſor, and this diſtinction is ſet forth amongſt, Schoole-men, by the termes of
<hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>ad ſemper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Rule is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule.</hi>
3.</note> Euery commandement forbidding any ſinne, doth not onely forbid the ſinne named, but all ſins of the ſame ranke alſo, and all occaſions of the ſame; and the maine ſinne onely is named, to make the branches the more odious, as being of the ſame nature before the Lord. Thus Chriſt himſelfe interpreteth the ſixth, ſeauenth, and third commandements, where reprouing the Phariſees doctrine,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> only forbidding murther, and the act of adultery, and falſe ſwearing by Gods holy name, he teacheth, that euen vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed anger is a ſinne, and to looke vpon a woman to luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her is adultery, and to ſweare any oath at all in ordinary communication, is from the Diuell, by which we may gather how we are to vnderſtand the other commandements alſo.</p>
               <p>The fourth rule is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule.</hi>
4.</note> The Commandements of the firſt table are abſolutely to be kept, and for themſelues, the other of the ſecond table are to bee kept for the firſt. For, if any man ſhall obſerue this, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but mee. Thou ſhalt not make any grauen Image, &amp;c. or thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord in vaine,</hi> in meere obedience to the Kings Lawes, or thereby to pleaſe holy men, who doe ſpit at the workers of ſuch abhominations, and not through an imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reuerence of that heauenly maieſty which hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that mans obedience is none obedience, his keeping of theſe lawes is no keeping of them, becauſe the maine thing heere intended is neglected, viz. the ſetting vp of God in our hearts aboue all, and that which is moſt abhorred, is practiſed, viz. <hi>the feare of God taught by the preceps of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa 29.13.</note> And on the other ſide, who ſo ſhall obſerue theſe lawes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, &amp;c.</hi> without being moued herevnto through a conſcience of the firſt table, commending the loue of God vnto vs, and the loue of man for Gods cauſe, after <pb n="194" facs="tcp:767:114"/> whoſe Image he is made: his keeping alſo is no keeping of the law, becauſe the praiſe of men is the marke, at which he ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, or elſe, that he may be dealt friendly withall againe, and thus did the very Phariſees and Publicans.<note place="margin">Math. 6.

                     <hi>Rule.</hi> 5.</note>The fift Rule is this. Howſoeuer the leaſt commandement is not ſo ſmall, but the breach thereof deſerueth death; yet the breaches of ſome commandements are greater, and more heynous, then of others. Thus to breake the commandements of the firſt Table is in it ſelfe ſimply more heynous, and this ſinne ſhall haue a more grieuous puniſhment in hell then ſinnes againſt the ſecond table. For Sodom and Gomorrah, ſaith Chriſt vnto the Iewes,<note place="margin">Math 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall riſe vp againſt you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you:</hi> becauſe their ſinne in refuſing and denying their God and Sauiour was greater then all the ſinnes, though moſt loud crying of that people. And for this is it, that the maine ſinnes againſt euery precept of the firſt Table were cenſured with death, but it is not ſo with all thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</p>
               <p>Yet doe I not ſo rigorouſly preſſe this rule, as to inferre, that the leaſt ſinne againſt the firſt Table, muſt needs bee more heynous then the greateſt againſt the ſecond, which hath beene raſhly concluded by ſome. Can any Chriſtian perſwade mee that I commit a more damnable ſinne in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouertaken with a nap at a long Sermon, or comming once late to Church, then if I had murthered my owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Let me be throwne out of a window if I thinke that. <hi>Eutychus, Act.</hi> 20.9 ſinned more grieuouſly then <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4 8. In gathering a proportion betweene one ſin and another, all reſpect is not to be had to the obiect againſt whom the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is done, but regard muſt bee had alſo of the kinde of the action committed, of the malice or infirmity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, &amp;c. Theſe bee ſometime ſo ſuperlatiue, that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbalance the generall reſpect to the obiect. The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore betweene the two Tables, is, to receiue modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and moderation by reſtraints, as
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> or where there is not ouermuch imparity otherwiſe,

               <p>The ſixt Rule is this, there is ſo neere a relation betwixt all the commandements of the morall law,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Explan.</hi> The method which I intend generally to follow in opening the commandements, is firſt to handle the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it ſelfe, and then the reaſon, and in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement theſe two parts, the duty inioyned, and vice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, where the commandement is affirmatiue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, firſt the vice forbidden, and then the duty, when it is negatiue. This firſt commandement is mixt, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of both, thou ſhalt haue me for thy God, and none other.<note place="margin">1. Duty Inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Touching the duty it is to haue, and to ſet vp in our hearts and practices, the Lord <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who only raigneth in Heauen and in earth, for our God, which is the maine and principall ſcope of the whole Law: euen as the maine duty of a Subiect towards his Prince, is to acknowledge him, and to ſweare allegeance vnto him, which if it be not, what will all other Lawes and Statutes auaile? What likelihood is there of being contained in obedience in other things? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none at all; but that the perſon which is vnconformable in the firſt, will liue like a diſorderly Riotour, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Traytor. So if we refuſe to ſet vp the true God in our hearts, which is our vowing allegiance, what other account can the Lord make of vs, but as of a company of Out-lawes, and vnworthy to liue in the Common-wealth of his Church, and to bee fellow-Citizens with his Saints. Now the Lord is not then acknowledged, this duty is not then perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when we make profesſion in word, and outwardly of ſeruing the true God, but when wee loue him in the higheſt <pb n="197" facs="tcp:767:115"/> degree, when we feare him, truſt in him, and ſeeke vnto him, in all our necesſities. Wherefore Almighty God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting vpon this precept, in other places of his holy Word, hath ſhewed expresſly how earneſtly hee requireth all theſe things.</p>

And heere may bee alſo numbred in generall ſuch as loue their owne wills more then Gods holy will: for that if a priuate offence be committed againſt them, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:767:121"/> they fall into a great rage, and ſeeke reuenge; but if againſt God, they are meanly, or not at all moued, they honour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more than God.</p>

The creature is ſet in the roome of the Creator by truſt, and confidence, whereby the creature is ſo relyed vpon, as that with it there is totall aſſurance and no feare: but if it be wanting, nothing but feare, and mournfull deſpaire, and thus the couetous man is the ſecond time an Idolater, becauſe when his barnes and ſtorehouſes bee full of goods, hee chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp his ſoule, and biddeth it be merry, his heart telleth him, that in his need, the wedge of gold will come and helpe him: but if by any caſualty theſe things faile him, he hath no comfort, no reſt, but pineth away, and walketh about like a ſhadow, as though his life conſiſted in his goods. Thus they which truſt in men are idolaters, and the people of Iſrael are often ſharply reproued for ſo doing, the Prophet ſometime threatning them for their more groſſe outward idolatry, ſometime for this more ſecret, and inward by truſting in the King of Aegypt, and Ethiopia.
<hi>Dauid</hi> was alſo infected heerewith, when he cauſed his people to be numbred, and all ſuch amongſt vs as wholly and meerely truſt in the great forces of vnited nations, or helpe from beyond the Seas in the day of battell.

<hi>Haman</hi> did, and therefore is there none end of their inſolencies: and alſo ſuch as truſt to Horſes, and weapons, ſhips and Caſtles, and other furniture for the warres, none are ſo bold as theſe in the time of peace, and none ſo forſaken in the day of danger, and ſo cowardly, and the reaſon is, becauſe their God, in whom they truſted, the arme of fleſh, appeareth to be a vaine thing to ſaue a man. Laſt and worſt of all are witches and Wizards, and all ſuch as ſeeke vnto them in their ſickneſſe, or loſſes, theſe are expreſſe idolaters, haue palpably changed their God, and therefore the true God hath commanded, that they ſhould not bee ſuffered to liue. They ſet vp his greateſt enemy the deuell, and the leaſt offenders this way doe in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſay to the blacke fiend of hell, come and help vs. Which <pb n="209" facs="tcp:767:121"/> (Lord) open their eyes to ſee, that run daily to theſe ſiniſter meanes, from God to Satan, that they may be finally deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Satan.</p>

But wee muſt here take heede, that wee make not this Commandement ſtricter, then the Lord hath made it, to caſt a ſnare vpon the conſciences of men: it is true, that as the Image, ſo the Image-maker, and Image-worſhipper are alike abominable, and ſo bee all ſuch, as wittingly labour about any ornament, or imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the ſetting forth of Idolatrie. But God forbid, that euerie Image and Image-maker, ſhould bee therfore accounted abominable; for ſo the excellent Art of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſeruing in liuely colours ſo to expreſſe our friends ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as if they were euer preſent with vs, and picturing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emblemes of vertue and vice, for ornament and delight, ſhould cleane bee put downe, and our very coyne were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>

Thus the old Romans offended not, in painting a drunken man goggle eyd, foaming at the mouth: thus Time is well pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, bald behind, and hairy before: Iuſtice with a paire of ſcales, with the hands and eyes ſhut, &amp;c.

Of this commemoratiue nature, was the vſe of the tranſeunt ſigne of the Croſſe in baptiſme, amongſt the moſt ancient Fathers in the purer times. Nor can I vpon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſee any iuſt reaſon why the ſame ſhould not bee ſo reputed, as it is now in vſe retained in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being intended as a ſigne meerely monitory, not opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; that is, as putting vs in mind of our duty and profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as infuſing any ſpirituall grace or protection, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp any part of that Sacrament, as imperfect without it.

Their danger is ſet forth by three degrees.

Things impoſsible are either ſo vnto al men, as to reſtore the dead to life, to heale incurable diſeaſes, &amp;c. or though not vnto all, yet to the party that voweth, as if a poore man ſhould vow, that hee would be a King, a man bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the diſpoſition of his mind and body, that he wil euer liue chaſte a ſingle life, or a lame Creeple, that hee will goe a foote forty miles in a day. Of this kind is the vow commonly made by the Romiſh Prieſts, and Votaries, that enter into any religious order, ſeeing that moſt of them doe daily ſhew by wofull experience, that it is as poſsible to liue pure, and free from all ſinne, as from ſinning againſt that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vow.

I can goe on in more lewd examples of the moſt eminent in the Romiſh Church, euen in the vnerring demi-gods, but modeſty bids me forbeare. If it ſhould bee obiected, that theſe haue been but the faults of ſome ſpeciall men, it appeareth to be moſt falſe by Popes tollerations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Counſels, and iuſtifications of Popiſh Writers.

He that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed a bullocke, was as if hee had ſlaine a man, hee that offered a ſheepe, as if hee had cut off a dogges head.

But alas, good men, they were in an errour, as will plainely appeare, if wee conſider firſt, that the Lord hath commaunded his people to ſweare by his name, not once, but oftner, as was ſhewed a little before out <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Iere</hi> 41. where it is put for a maine part of his worſhip: and of him that ſhall dwell in the Tabernacle of the moſt High, it is ſaid, that he ſweareth to his owne hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and changeth not.

<hi>Abraham, Iaacob, Ioſeph,</hi> &amp;c haue ſworne vpon ſome occaſions, which they would not haue done, if it had onely beene tolerated vnto the people, becauſe of the hardneſſe of their heart. 2.

1. That it is lawfull to ſweare, to confirme a neceſſarie truth, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe cannot be knowne, is plaine from the examples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. The Apoſtle ſware, to confirme the Philippians and Corinthians, of his vnfained loue towards them, and the Angel, that Time ſhould be no more, which were weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie things, and neceſſary to be knowne certainely, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Goſpell, and yet ſo hidden, that they could

For the making of leagues and couenants ſure, it was the common practiſe of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iaacob,</hi> and all holy men to ſweare by the true God, that he being called to be witnes of what they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, they might not dare to deale falſly. 3. The lawfull Magiſtrate is Gods Vicegerent heere vpon earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if hee call thee to ſweare, thou muſt not refuſe, but obey herein:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> for to obey the lawfull Magiſtrat, is to obey God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powers that bee, are ordeined of God.

Although it be a truth, vnto which thou ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, yet if thou knoweſt it not to bee ſo, thou art periured, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe thou ſweareſt contrary to thy conſcience 2. If thou ſweareſt in doubtfull words, hauing another meaning, then thou knoweſt him to haue, before whom thou ſweareſt, thou abuſeſt this ordinance of God. Thus the Ieſuites play with oathes, by their equiuocations, and mentall reſeruations: and with them agree too many Shop keepers, liuing vpon buying and ſelling, that will ſweare, that their ware coſt them thus much, meaning the whole, when the buyer is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the yard, or the ell: or, that they were bidden ſuch a price, meaning of their wife, or companions, for a colour, when as the buyer is made to beleeue, that if they would haue taken that money, they might haue ſolde it ſo, yer that time, with many other deuices, to deceiue their owne ſoules.</p>

                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:767:141"/>3 To ſweare things impoſsible, or vnlawfull, is to mocke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God, as if a man ſhould call his neighbour to witneſſe, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanting with a thiefe to rob his houſe, or to cut his throat: or if a Subiect ſhould call his Prince, to ſee him build an houſe in the aire, to flie with the fowles, or to make his horſe ſpeake, which were meere mockeries.</p>

               <p>The reaſon may be framed thus. If the ſame reaſon groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Gods word, be as wel for the firſt day of the weeke, as it was once for the Sabbath of the Iewes, then wee are as certainly tied to the obſeruation of this day, as they were for their Sabbath: but there is the ſame reaſon. Therefore wee are certainly tied vnto this day.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of this argument is plaine, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is of the ſame force, the ſecond part appeareth by the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces noted in the margent. The maine reaſon of the Sabbath of the Iewes is, becauſe it was the Sabbath of the Lord, and therefore his people muſt neceſſarily do him this honour, that there might be a conformitie betwixt God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and in like manner, our Sabbath is the Sabbath of the Lord Chriſt, when he had finiſhed the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for which cauſe hee alſo giueth the ſame name; <hi>The Sonne of man is euen Lord of the Sabbath:</hi> As if in more words he ſhould ſay: When God the Father had once ended the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world, he reſted and publiſhed himſelfe to be the Lord of that reſt, and dedicated it vnto himſelfe, giuing it the name of the Sabbath of the Lord: In like manner, when I ſhall haue finiſhed the worke of mans redemption, I will reſt, and will haue the day of my reſt dedicated vnto my ſelfe, for which cauſe, I ſay, that the Sonne of man is euen Lord of the Sabbath alſo, it ſhall bee called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Explan.</hi> That we may the better know the duty of this Commandement, it is to be vnderſtood, that the word Father is diuerſly taken in the Scriptures, euen for euery ſuperiour in any thing. 1. For our ſuperiour in gouernment, thus euery King is called a Father, becauſe he is <hi>Parens Patriae</hi> the Father of the Countrey, it was a common name of the Kings of the Philiſtines, who were called <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen 20.3.</note> which is the King my father. 2. For a Superiour in knowledge, and in wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, thus the counſellours of State, are Fathers of the State, as <hi>Ioſeph, Pharaohs</hi> chiefe Councellour, ſpeaketh of himſelfe, <hi>God hath made me a father vnto Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45 8.</note> and
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> cauſed the name <hi>Abrech,</hi> that is, Father, to bee proclaimed before him; and the Senatours of Rome were commonly called,
<hi>Patres conſcripti,</hi> reuerend Fathers. 3. For a Superiour, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and houſhold gouernment, thus maſters of families are called,
<hi>Patres Familias,</hi> Fathers of the Familie, as <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian is called Father, by his ſeruants. 4. For a Superiour,<note place="margin">2 King. 5.13.</note> in the inuention of any Art or Science:<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> thus <hi>Iubal</hi> is ſaid to be the father of all that play on the Organs and harpe; and <hi>Iabal,</hi> the father of all that make tents. 5. For a Superiour, in things ſpirituall towards God: thus the Miniſters of the Goſpell are called Fathers in Chriſt, becauſe that through <pb n="304" facs="tcp:767:169"/> that ſpirituall knowledge and grace exceeding others, they beget men vnto God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> as
<hi>Paul,</hi> who therefore cals the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians his little children, and profeſſeth to the Corinthians, that hee onely was their father, for, <hi>J begat you,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>vnto Chriſt.</hi> 6. For a Superiour in holineſſe and power with God: thus the King of Iſrael calleth
<hi>Eliſha</hi> Father, ſaying of the Hoaſt of the Syrians,<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall I ſmite them, my Father?</hi>
7.<note place="margin">2.

For a Superiour in eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; thus rich men vſing their riches aright, are fathers of the poore,<note place="margin">Iob 31.28.</note> 
                  <hi>From my youth hee hath growne vp with mee, as with a father,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. For a Superior in age and yeares; thus the gray-headed is called a father, and the ancient are as fathers to be exhorted, and not to bee rebuked. 10 Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common acception amongſt children,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.</note> there is a naturall father and mother, which beget, beare, and bring vs foorth, and vp in the world, and if one of them dieth, or he, or ſhee, that ſuruiueth, bee married againe, and hee or ſhee vnto whom, is now made alſo thy father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though not by nature, yet by law, and there is an honour due vnto them.</p>

That tithes are due euen in theſe dayes, appeareth, from direct Scripture; <hi>All the tithes of the ſeed of the ground, and of the fruit of the trees are the Lords, they are wholy to the Lord</hi> he ſaith not, ſhall be, or let them be, as <hi>Origen</hi> hath well obſerued of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremoniall Lawes, which were to laſt but for a time, as of the Paſſouer, <hi>This ſhall be a Law or an ordinance vnto thee:</hi> and ſo of other ceremonies. But as it is ſaid of the ſeuenth day, <hi>it is the Lords Sabbath</hi> ſo of tithes,<note place="margin">Exod 12.24.</note>
                  <hi>they are the Lords.</hi> Whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this ſound reaſon. That which is the Lords peculiarly, &amp; perpetually, &amp; not by any new ordination for a time, that is to be paid alwaies, without al difference of times of the old and new Teſtament: but ſuch are tithes, they are the Lords, &amp; not made ſo by any ſuch ordination, therefore they are to be paid euen vnder the new Teſtament alſo. It cannot be maintained, that tithes are ceremonial, or appurtenances of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:767:203"/> Prieſthood: for God, though he gaue them to the Leuites, yet did he not firſt found them in that encorporation: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferred his owne right to that Order of Prieſt-hood <hi>quouſque,</hi> ſo long as it ſhould endure, and after the ceaſing of that Prieſt-hood, the ſame right deſcended, as it were, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to the ſucceeding Miniſtery of the Goſpell. In a word; Tythes were due to the Leuiticall Miniſters, not as Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, but as Miniſters; and ſo are ſucceſsiuely due to the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Paſtors, as Paſtors, and not formally as Euangelicall. And if <hi>per impoſsibile,</hi> the Goſpell could ceaſe, yet ſhould not tythes ceaſe, but be rendred to whatſoeuer Miniſtery could be feigned to ſucceed in place thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This appeareth further by Scripture,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.14.</note> concluding the <label type="milestone">

Therefore tythes are due now in theſe dayes of the Goſpell.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and there he is ſaid to haue receiued tythes, that liueth for euer &amp;c.</hi> Hence I reaſon thus: That which is Chriſts due, as he is a meanes of Gods bleſsing vnto the people, that is the due of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſeruing in the ſame office: but tythes are Chriſts due, ſeeing they were <hi>Melchiſedecks,</hi> euen as they were due to the Prieſts after <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe due to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and they are Chriſts and <hi>Melchiſedecks,</hi> as they were a meanes of bleſsing; for, <hi>Eo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomine,</hi> in this reſpect <hi>Abraham</hi> is noted to haue paied tythes <pb n="374" facs="tcp:767:204"/> to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> when he met him, and bleſſed him. Therefore they are due to the Miniſters of the Goſpell. And to ſuch as will vnderſtand, the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> is moſt plaine for tithes: <hi>Let him that is inſtructed, make him that hath inſtructed him, partaker of all his goods.</hi>

Thus there remaineth no way elſe to make him partaker of al thy goods, but by the due paying of thy tithes from all ſorts of thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed goods, namely, which ariſe from thy Corne, from thy Fruite, from thy Cattell, &amp;c. which are called, all thy goods.</p>

Now, the Lord paſſeth on heere, in reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp particular euill motions againſt our neighbour, and ſaith nothing of motions againſt his owne Maieſty, not that men are not as apt heerein to ſinne againſt God, nether for that theſe motions are more excuſable; but becauſe as more hainous in any common vnderſtanding, they are to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rather, being againſt him, from whom euery good thing, and onely good commeth.</p>

For that which ſome haue fondly taken vpon them to performe in groſſe and outward manner, ſequeſtring themſelues from all wordly imployment, that they might ſpend their whole time in prayer, tying themſelues therefore to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prayers, or to the rehearſall of the ſame prayers many times ouer, to make vp the number, counted ſometime by little ſtones, more lately by beads; this, I ſay, as it is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and vocally vſed by Monkes and Heretiques, commeth too neere the practice of ancient fond heretiques, called

But take heed, leſt in praying theſe words, the tongue runne without the heart, as it muſt needes doe, in thoſe that ceremoniouſly rehearſe them, making haſt to haue done, euen like vnto a chlide ſaying his leſſon, which he hath conned perfectly. Such may ſay the words of Gods deare <pb n="424" facs="tcp:767:229"/> Son, and yet goe away without any notice taken of them, becauſe they pray not his words, which is a harder matter to doe. Wherefore, to pray theſe words rightly, thou muſt in ſome conuenient meaſure vnderſtand them, and haue the minde taken vp with them, in the vttering the heart ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying it ſelfe into the meaning of euery petition, which that it may be done, there muſt be vſed good deliberation in him that prayeth.</p>
               <p>Thus, if this prayer be ſaid, it is well vſed alone, or added to other prayers: like vnto a wraſtler, who hauing vſed his beſt skill and ſtrength, to ouercome in his wraſtling, yet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the victory, getting to bee very hard, hee re-inforceth himſelfe at the laſt, with all his might, force and skill, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that he may carry away the prize: ſo the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man wraſtling, as <hi>Iaacob</hi> with God by prayer, in the end re-inforceth himſelfe in this prayer, that he may not depart vnbleſſed. Two extreames are heere to be taken heed of: The one is, too much confidence in the words of this prayer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, as ſome Popes of Rome haue granted great pardons to ſeuen <hi>Paternoſters,</hi> and as many
<hi>Aue Maries,</hi> ſaid ouer euery day, or on ſome dayes, and in ſome places: which is groſſe and ſuperſtitious: The other is, too much detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this prayer, by accounting it no better, or not ſo worthy, as a mans owne conceiued prayer, which is deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie and arrogant.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> Yes doubtleſſe; for otherwiſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles would not haue vſed ſuch variety of order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in thankſgiuings, requeſts, and deprcations, for his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall children, for himſelfe, for the whole Church: nor would the primitiue Chriſtians, in their ioynt prayer for the Apoſtles haue beene ſo bold as to premiſe this part of thankſgiuing, before their intreating of Gods asſiſtance to the Apoſtolicall offices, as they did, when

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Anſw."/> It is true indeed: wee know not of our ſelues, as naturall men, what to aske, but the Spirit of God teacheth vs, partly enlightening vs by the Word of God, and partly ſtirring vp this heauenly motion in our mindes, to pray, and long after the fulneſſe of Gods grace, which is an argument of our full deliuerance from mortality and baſeneſſe, into perfect glory of ſoule and body, and this onely is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place. Againe, becauſe prayer is the worke of Gods Spirit, it may bee hence gathered, that all ſuch as haue the Spirit, and are regenerate, doe and are able in ſome meaſure to pray, to their owne comfort, hauing none other helps of prayers made by men, or aforehand deuiſed by themſelues. Yet it doth not hence follow, that it is not good to pray in ſet formes of prayer, no more that it is not good to haue ſtaires, to goe vp into an vpper roome, becauſe a man may make a ſhift to goe vp by a ladder, or by ſome other meanes.</p>
               <p>In publique, for the ordinary ſeruice of God, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full there ſhould bee ſet formes of prayer, becauſe it is not certaine, that euery Miniſter of Gods Word hath the <pb n="426" facs="tcp:767:230"/> Spirit of Prayer in him to teach him: and if hee had, there would be danger through weakneſſes of memory, of omitting many things needfull to bee prayed for in the congregation, of excurſions, and runnings out into clauſes impertinent, and idle, in ſo long prayers, and of tautologies, and repeating the ſame things againe and againe, to the wearying of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>

And the firſt is, to conſider rightly, vnto whom we pray, and with what faith and affiance. Hee, vnto whom, is called Father, teaching vs both who can pray, and what faith is required in praying. Firſt, he only can pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and as a true Chriſtian, that can call God Father by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption &amp; grace through Ieſus Chriſt. It is not ſufficient; that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:767:232"/> hee be thy Father by creation, for ſo is he the father of the ſpirits now damned in hell: but he muſt alſo be thy Father by regeneration, through the preaching of his word, caſting thee into a new mold of righteouſnes and holines, according to his Image,<note place="margin">Rom.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.9. </note>Whence it followeth, that a wicked man liuing in ſinne, cannot pray, ſeeing he, which is borne of God, ſinneth not, who only is indued with the Spirit of Prayer. All his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is a vaine beating of the ayre with a ſound of words, neither ſhall he ſpeed any more then <hi>Eſau</hi> of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing belonging to the firſt borne, though he cryed with ſtrong cryes and bitter. Hee may wiſh indeed as <hi>Balaam, Let me dye the dea h of the righteous</hi> but he cannot pray, &amp; ſo is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit heereof, theſe wiſhes differing ſo farre from faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt praying and wiſhing.</note>1. Becauſe wiſhes are ſudden and inconſiderate, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ceaſing as a ball rebounding, when it is at the higheſt, it falleth againe; prayer is with deliberation, and giueth not ouer without ſpeeding of the thing deſired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wiſhes are without reſpect of the meanes and care of right or wrong, in attaining the thing wiſhed for: Prayer is with ſubmisſion to the vſe of the meanes, and care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing by right onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wiſhes, are for the moſt part of things worldly, I would I had ſuch an houſe, ſuch riches, &amp;c. prayer, is chiefly for things ſpirituall, and heauenly, one only petition of ſixe being for things temporall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wiſhes are ſometime for things ſpirituall and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but very inconſtant as <hi>Balaams</hi> wiſh, and that of

                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:767:232"/>Furthermore, as a wicked man cannot pray, ſo his ſaying of prayers is an abhomination to the Lord. Of the wicked Iewes
<hi>Incenſe is abhomination to me,</hi> ſaith the Lord: and <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is abomination to the Lord. The King, or ſome noble perſon would diſdaine it much, to bee waited vpon at the Table with Clownes all miry, and dirty, and the King of heauen is no leſſe offended, if any wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire of ſinne, come to giue attendance vpon him in prayer. Woe then to wicked perſons, that will, ſteale, whoore, prophane the Sabbath, drinke, oppreſſe, and kill, and yet come and worſhip in the Lords Houſe. This is ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, that euen naturall men, and Pagans doe abhorre it in Chriſtians. <hi>Penda</hi> an heathen king of the Mercians,<note place="margin">Hovvs Chron. pag. 67.</note> would not ſuffer any Chriſtians, that liued contrary to their profeſſion to goe vnpunniſhed: So the Turke doth at this day. See then here the horrible eſtate of wicked men, pray they ought, it being a common duty of all men, and yet pray they cannot; yea, they ſinne, if they pray, ſuch a maze or Labyrinth doth ſinne bring them into.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, from the perſon, vnto whom we are directed to pray, wee learne, if wee bee ſuch, as can rightly call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to come with all boldneſſe, and confidence vnto him.

                  <hi>Ought we not much more bee ſubiect to the Father of Spirits?</hi> We may therefore pray vnto the whole Trinity, but more properly vnto the firſt perſon, God the Father, in the name of God the Sonne, by the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God the holy Ghoſt.

                  <note place="margin">The order of the petition. </note>The order of placing the petitions concerning Gods glory firſt, and then thoſe concerning our ſelues, teacheth, 1. that God is abſolutely to be reſpected, and for himſelfe, but man for Gods cauſe. He is the Soueraigne Lord of all, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of him ought to ſway all; the greateſt men are not ſo to be reuerenced ſimply for their power and greatnes, but for him,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.28.</note> and in him; <hi>I will tell you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) whom yee ſhall feare, <hi>not him that can kill the body, but him that can deſtroy body and ſoule in hell fire.</hi> And this is the argument vſed by the Apoſtle, to perſwade obedience to the higher powers,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe there are no powers but of God, and the powers that are, are of God</hi> Euen as the riuers come from the ſea, and runne into the ſea, ſo all mens greatneſſe, and that they are men, commeth from God, and ends in God. If God commandeth any thing, he is to be heard for his commands ſake; if man commandeth any thing, he is to be heard for Gods ſake, which if it were ſo, ſinne ſhould not ſo much haue the vpper hand: but this is turned amongſt the men of this age, into the contrary, man is heard, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for himſelfe, God for man, a plaine euidence, whereof is the obedience of the moſt vnto great perſons and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and neglect of Gods poore Miniſters armed only with the Word, the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the firſt, and maine thing by the Lord intended
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:767:235"/> in creating all, is his owne glory, and whatſoeuer is good for man is ſubordinate vnto this, and onely ſo farre forth to bee ſought after, as it maketh for Gods glory. The heauens are made to ſhew his glory, the earth, and ſeas are for his glory, al men are made for his glory, yea, the veſſels of wrath: for of him, <hi>for him, and vnto him are all things, to him be glory, for euer,</hi>

                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> This made <hi>Moſes</hi> to neglect his owne ſoule, rather then God ſhould be diſhonoured, and <hi>Paul</hi> to lay open himſelfe to the curſe, that God might haue glory by the conuerſion of the Iewes. And this will make euery one, that is an obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the King of heauen, with ioy to beare any croſſe, ſo that God may haue glory, to account all loſſe, which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his diſhonour. For if the maine eſtate of any man bee ſafe, he is the leſſe troubled at ſmall loſſes; but much leſſe if hundreths of pounds bee daily added hereunto, and his loſſes be but ſome few pence: no more ought wee to be much troubled at our owne loſſes, or croſſes, ſeeing the maine, Gods glory, is hereby greatly increaſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the glory of the Lords name is ſo deare, as that hee did not only make it his marke in the creation, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular dutie done by man, hee ſetteth it ſtill, as his marke, as here in prayer, in giuing the law, he beginneth with his owne maieſty in the Goſpell, at the very natiuity of that bleſſed one the Angels are heard lauding, and glorifying God. And in like manner ought wee to bee affected to Gods glory in euery duty ſeeking this firſt, and chiefely, and not to be ſeene of men, as the Phariſees. For if a man doth faſt, pray, heare the word, giue almes, deale iuſtly in ſome other reſpect chiefely, he breakes this rule of Chriſt, he pleaſeth not, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, or how oft ſoeuer his deuotion bee, hee can haue no thankes at Gods hands.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27. </note>
                  <hi>Explan.</hi> To follow the method before vſed, in the three firſt petitions: The ſpeciall order of this petition, before that which is for the remiſſion of ſins, is firſt to be conſidered, and becauſe it is immediately after this Petition: <hi>Thy will bee done.</hi> It is placed before this; <hi>Forgiue vs our Treſpaſſes, &amp;c.</hi> Not for that the things of this life are to be ſought, before thoſe that concerne the life to come: for againſt ſuch ſurmiſes, the Lord hath plainely commanded; <hi>Seeke not the foode that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, <pb n="461" facs="tcp:767:247"/> but that which endureth vnto eternall life,</hi> that is, in regard of your earneſt care and ſtudy, for ſpirituall food and ſaluation, euen neglect ſeeking daily bread.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this order then is, to prouide againſt our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, whereby wee diſtruſt God, for bread, food, rayment, and worldly deliuerances, when we profeſſe, that we belieue in him, for the remisſion of ſin, and deliuerance from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Lord Ieſus being priuy to this our weakneſſe, to make vs to ſee, and to be aſhamed of it, followeth our own order, both ſecretly taxing this our corruption, and diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our little faith, euen for maine matters, concerning ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and alſo helping it, by beginning with things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, wherein we haue a ſenſible taſte of Gods goodneſſe, and aſcending to things ſpirituall, and out of all bodily ſenſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſheweth, how much we prefer the food that periſheth,<note place="margin">We aske bread before remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, why?</note> that finding it to be true in our own hearts, we may be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed of theſe immoderate worldly cares: much more, than other naturall creatures, the Fowles of the ayre, &amp; the graſſe of the field, we hauing reaſon to lead vs, which they want:<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> for thus <hi>doe the Heathen,</hi> which haue no knowledge of the heauenly Father caring for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſheweth the deceitfulneſſe of our hearts in regard of Faith, we thinking wee haue a great meaſure heereof, but being proued lyars, when wee come to the tryall, by the ſmaller things of this life: for when the diſciples were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of worldly cares, <hi>Why care yee for theſe things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> ſaith the Lord,
<hi>O yee of little faith:</hi> and when <hi>Peter,</hi> ready to ſinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid for the waues of the Sea, cryed out, <hi>Maſter, ſaue me.</hi> The Lord rebuketh him ſaying, <hi>O thou of little faith, why diddeſt thou doubt?</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, there is little faith indeed, if there bee diſtruſtfull caring for wordly things in time of want, or deſpaire in time of danger. S. <hi>Paul</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the contrary ſide, from faith making Chriſt ours, and peace with God belieued.
<hi>Wherefore we reioyce in tribulation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1. Rom.

He that beleeueth not that the King will giue him ſixepence, how can hee beleeue that he will giue him an hundreth pounds? And if thou canſt <pb n="462" facs="tcp:767:248"/> not through faith patiently wait the good pleaſure of the Lord for things temporall, which are of no valew, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of heauenly, how canſt thou through faith depend vpon him for heauen, and euerlaſting life?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord prouideth here for the ſtrengthening of our Faith touching things eternall, by aſcending from theſe his gifts below, wherein we taſte of his goodneſſe daily. For whereas the Lord, notwithſtanding our ſinnes, giueth vs the comforts of this life, for which we call vpon him, hee doth hereby draw vs on to lift vp our minds to the comfort of the remisſion of all our ſinnes, and of euerlaſting ſaluation. As <hi>Dauid</hi> is drawne on in his confidence againſt the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtims,<note place="margin">2 Sam 17 37.</note> becauſe God had deliuered him from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Beare. The begger that comming daily to the doore of the charitable Chriſtian, findeth reliefe; or if hee commeth not, hath it ſent home vnto him, doth heereby aſſure himſelfe of this mans loue and good will towards him: ſo when we finde reliefe at the Lords hands, eſpecially crauing it at his gate of mercy, in faith and aſſurance, wee may well be aſſured that he beareth a fauour towards vs, and will not ſuffer vs to periſh in our ſinnes, wee putting our truſt in his mercy. So that as from our weakneſſe about the things of this life, we may ſee the weakneſſe of our faith, about the things of the life to come: ſo from Gods goodneſſe towards vs heere, we truſting in his mercy, wee may alſo ſee and bee confirmed touching his goodneſſe heereafter, putting our truſt in the ſame his infinite mercy.</p>
               <p>Againe, conſider in the order, that it followeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after this. <hi>Thy will be done;</hi> becauſe to haue things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our maintenance heere is a ſtay, and helpe vnto vs, the more cheerefully to doe the will of God, and to keepe vs from vnlawfull enterprizes. Whence we are taught.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not vnlawfull euen for Chriſtians to ſeeke for the things of this life in their due place and meaſure; neither is this ſeeking an impeachment to our Chriſtian profeſſion, otherwiſe our Sauiour Chriſt would not haue appointed vs to aske, <hi>Give vs this day our daily bread.</hi> Wherefore as to bee ouer carefull for things temporall, is heathiniſh diſſidence, <pb n="463" facs="tcp:767:248"/> ſo to be altogether negligent and ſecure,<note place="margin">1 Tim 5.8.</note> is worſe then heatheniſh infidelity, as the Apoſtle teacheth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The rule of our ſeeking things temporall muſt be not our owne, but the will of God; for after this wee pray, <hi>Giue vs our daily bread,</hi> that is, according to thy will and good pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining vs from all vnlawfull meanes of getting, that by true, iuſt, and equall dealing onely wee may ſeeke theſe things, not carking when thou wouldſt haue vs ſecure, not ſparing, when thou wouldſt haue vs to ſpend, not truſting to our owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,<note place="margin">1 Pet.
5.7.</note> when thou wouldſt haue vs to caſt our care vpon thee. For whatſoeuer is thus gotten is extreame loſſe, the loſſe of the moſt precious ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee learne, that they onely vſe the goods of this world rightly, and ſeek them rightly, that vſe them as furtherances to do the will of God, and make this their marke which they ſhoot at in ſeeking after them, &amp; not their own pleaſure,<note place="margin">Iam 5.5.</note> or promotion in the world. They which ſeek riches to liue herevpon in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; to pamper themſelues are accurſed of God, and ſhall haue a terrible reckoning to make at the laſt day. Riches are vſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will. 1. By liberality towards the poore. 2. To pious vſes for the glory of God. 3. To neceſſary vſes for the maintenance of our ſelues and families, &amp; to the benefit of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth. For the ſenſe of the words. By bread heere, ſome of the Fathers were wont to vnderſtand the body of Chriſt, and the Papiſts the Sacrament of the Altar; and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">By bread what vnderſtood.</note> that it is not likely that any worldly thing ſhould be asked in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſhort a prayer. But this cannot be yeelded to be true.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this Prayer is a perfect patterne for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all things</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe our ſpirituall food is asked in the ſecond petition the comming of Gods Kingdome being the beſtowing of his grace, and ſpecially of Chriſt the fountaine of all grace vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the bread heere asked, is but for this day which doth imply, a fading and waſting away, ſo as that wee ſtill haue need euery day of new bread, which cannot bee ſaid of our food ſpirituall. By bread therefore in this place, is to bee vnderſtood both bread and all things neceſſary for our <pb n="464" facs="tcp:767:249"/> ſuſtenance,<note place="margin">Leuit 26.26.</note> as the word Bread is vſed, where it is ſaid, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God:</hi> and where the Prophet threatneth; <hi>The Lord of Hoaſts will take away from Ieruſalem, and from Iudah all the ſtay, and the ſtrength,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa 3.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>all the ſtay of bread, and all the ſtay of water.</hi> And ſhewing further what this ſtay is, hee reckoneth vp all needfull things for the well-being of a Land:
<hi>The ſtrong man, the Iudge, the Prophet, the Counſellor, &amp;c.</hi> Sometime bread is properly vnderſtood, as where the Pſalmiſt reckoneth vp bread to ſtrengthen man, wine to cheere the heart,<note place="margin">Pſal.

                  <hi>Giue,</hi> that is, ſanctifie all worldly comforts vnto vs, which by reaſon of ſinne were and doe ſtand ſtill accurſed euer ſince the fall of man, that they may not bee deſtruction and bane vnto vs in the vſing, as wee deſerue; for I doe not thinke that ſinne depriueth a man of all iuſt title vnto theſe things, (for a ciuill right remaineth in wicked men to that they poſſeſſe by Law) but of comfort in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, they being vncleane and accurſed vnto them, neither doth this ſaying, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> conclude the contrary againſt ſinners, but expreſſeth how all things conſent together for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the faithfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Giue,</hi> that is, beſtowe, vphold, continue, and maintaine that which thou haſt giuen vs; for all our labour is nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining, and all our care nothing towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing and keeping what we haue, vnleſſe the Lord giue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Giue,</hi> that is, bleſſe, make proſperous and wholeſome our meates and drinkes for the ſtrengthening of our bodies, and for the cheering and refreſhing of our ſpirits; ſo as that our fraile liues may be vpheld, and we inabled to ſerue thee in the ſtrength of thy bleſſing in our callings; for it is not any meere naturall vertue in vs, that maketh our meates nouriſhable, but Gods bleſſing, for which it is alſo plaine which was ſaid before, <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25. </note>Fourthly, we craue iuſtification, through the death &amp; bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt,
<hi>who was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification:</hi> that the Lord would not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require our ſinnes at our hands, either holding vs guiltie, or puniſhing vs therefore in this world, or in the world to come, but that the ſacrifice of Chriſt may be a perfect attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for vs, and his precious blood effectuall to clenſe vs from all ſinne. Now of this iuſtification there are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the firſt, whereby of ſinners wee are made righteous, in the very act of our conuerſion: the ſecond, whereby our daily infirmities and failes are done away, and wee are ſtill notwithſtanding them reputed righteous. The firſt we pray for and deſire to be confirmed in it, through Gods grace, that our eſtate may be comfortable: the ſecond wee pray for, as wee haue need to preſerue our peace and comfort, when wee view our eſtate before God. Euen as a bankrupt debter fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great fauor with his creditors to forgiue his great debts, and being ready ſtill daily through his extreame want to run vpon the ſcore againe, is a daily ſutor for mercy vnto them, to continue this their fauour in forgiuing all.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, wee pray for loue and charity towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, through which wee may bee ready to forgiue them their treſpaſſes againſt vs: for our heart naturally is a corrupt fountaine, and wee are implacable when wee are offended, <pb n="476" facs="tcp:767:255"/> eſpecially if it be ſpitefully done againſt vs, or by an enemy. Wherefore wee pray, that when wrongs are done vnto vs, we may conſider, how much, and often wee haue offended the Lord, to what griefe of his holy Spirit, and with what hatefull hearts, preferring Sathan and his ſeruice before the ſeruice of the heauenly Maieſty: that as we would notwithſtanding haue all this forgiuen vnto vs, wee may frame our minds to forgiue the greateſt offences againſt vs, hee which hath done them acknowledging his fault. Thus Chriſt being asked, <hi>Should I forgiue my brother, if he ſinneth againſt me ſeauen times in a day?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth 18.21.</note> anſwereth, <hi>If he turneth againe, and ſaith, it repenteth me, I ſay not vntill ſeuen times, but vntill ſeuenty times ſeuen times.</hi> And for this cauſe he bringeth his Parable of the Lord, forgiuing ten thouſand of talents to his ſeruant; but finding him with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to exact the hundreth pence due vnto him from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſeruant, ſhewing hereby how vaine all our prayers are for the pardon of our ſinnes againſt God, if we refuſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the ſinnes of our fellow-ſeruants againſt vs. Let no man therefore deceiue himſelf, by keeping malice, and ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon men for wrong done vnto him, but through loue let him forgiue all: for if there be not this loue towards his brother, there is no loue towards God, and then it is ſure, that God beareth no loue towards him, his loue of God being an inſeperable reflexion of the ſun ſhine of Gods loue vpon him: euen as a blind man may aſſuredly know, that the Sunne doth not ſhine vpon him, becauſe he feeleth no warmth thereby in his body.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What we pray againſt.</note>2. The deprecation is againſt all things that may ſhut vp Gods mercy and compaſsion towards vs, &amp; make vs remaine ſtill bound in our ſinnes: which are,</p>

                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14. </note>Firſt, Blindneſſe of minde, and ignorance of our inward eſtate, which is through ignorance of the Law.

                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:767:256"/>Theſe are firſt, promiſes of mercy, how heinous ſoeuer our ſinnes haue been, <hi>Though your ſinnes were as crimſon, they ſhall bee made white as ſnow; though they were red as ſcarlet, they ſhall bee as wooll.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Thirdly, the indignity offered vnto God by deſpaire, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee refuſe to truſt him vpon his moſt faithfull word, and the ineuitable deſtruction of our owne ſoules hereby, vnto former moſt heinous ſinnes, this being added to make a man out of meaſure ſinfull. Wherefore we pray, that in this caſe wee may keepe our eyes faſtned vpon Gods promiſes, reuolue in our minds, and alwaies thinke vpon examples of mercy, and conſider that as long as we deſpaire not, we are not ſhut out from mercy; but hereby we are gone for euer, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſeeing we offer that vnto him, which we will not vnto a man making faith vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.11. </note>Fourthly, we pray againſt preſumption, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing of happineſſe to a mans ſelf vpon falſe grounds, either becauſe God is infinitely mercifull, and will not haue any to periſh whom he hath made, neither is ſo ſeuere as they preach of him. Which is the preſumption ſpoken of by the Pſalmiſt:
<hi>Theſe things thou diddeſt, and whileſt I held my peace, thou thoughteſt that I was like vnto thee:</hi> or becauſe his owne life is not ſo bad, as that the Lord can therefore iuſtly condemne him to death, but rather for his good deeds, is bound to giue him eternall life,<note place="margin">Luke 18 11.</note> as the Phariſie vaunteth himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>O Lord I thanke thee that J am not as other men, extortioners, vniuſt, adulterers, or euen as this Publican, I faſt twice in the weeke, &amp;c.</hi> or becauſe the Lord hath promiſed,<note place="margin">Ezech.

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:767:256"/> For this is a moſt vaine hope, life being moſt vncertaine, mans power to turne to God being meere weakneſſe, and ſin getting ſtronger hold vpon him, the longer he liueth therein, and making him more vnfit euery day to repent, according to that ſaying:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Qui non eſt hodie, cras minus aptus erit.</p>
                  <lg>

               <p>Wherefore wee pray heere, that by none of theſe deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full baites wee may bee allured to liue in ſinne, that we may not preſume vpon our owne righteouſneſſe, but reiect it as a menſtruous cloth, nor make a God of all mercy to our ſelues, when as hee is alſo moſt iuſt and ſeuere againſt ſinners, leaſt with thouſands we thus periſh for euer, when we little feare it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, malice and thirſting after reuenge, when iniurie hath been offered vnto vs. From this we deſire to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that we may the rather, we are to conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, how much the Lord hath forgiuen vs for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that both the Lord Ieſus, and all holy men haue forgiuen and prayed for their enemies, and the Diuell only is an implacable aduerſary.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>The ſupplication therefore is, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes:</hi> Let none of our ſinnes euer come in remembrance againſt vs, but be waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt: the deprecation, let nothing hinder, but that thou maiſt forgiue our treſpaſſes: the thankſgiuing, thou haſt turned our hearts, and forgiuen our treſpaſſes, wee praiſe thee therefore, and this alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the whole law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 129. What pray you for in the third of theſe, which is the ſixth petition of the Lords Prayer?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>That the Lord would not ſuffer vs to be carried away by the temptations of the world, the fleſh or the deuill to the committing of ſin, but that he would deliuer vs from the euill of all temptatious, both ſinne, and damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Explan.</hi> For the order of this petition, it is added vnto the former made for our ſoules good, ſo that there be two pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for our ſoules, and but one for our bodies, teaching vs, that our care for our eſtate ſpirituall before God ought to be double to our care for things temporall, and of this world. And good reaſon, becauſe the ſoule liueth for euer, the body but a ſhort time, the things of the ſoule are permanent, and laſting euer to the comfort of it, the things of the body are ſlitting, and fade ſoone away. Laſtly, the ſoule is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and of more worth, then the whole world, the body is baſe, euen as the duſt of the earth, from whence it was taken, and vnto which it ſhall returne againe. So that they do foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget themſelues, which care altogether for the body, and take little or no care for the ſoule, when it is poore, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and naked, as is the manner of moſt men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This petition is immediately ſubioyned after the other, crauing the pardon of ſinne, to teach vs, that this is not the only care of Chriſtians, to ſeeke to haue ſinne pardoned, but they ought as earneſtly to ſtriue againſt ſinne, and to reſiſt it

               <p n="3">3. After that we haue prayed for the pardon of ſinne, wee pray againſt temptations, tending to ſinne, being hereby taught, that a Chriſtian mans life is a continuall warfare, and when one enemy is ouercome, and vanquiſhed, hee muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide to incounter with another.

So in the ſpirituall warfare, the enemies muſt be continually watched againſt, and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe we ſhall bee taken, and ſpoiled of our ſoules.

2. We pray againſt ſolicitations to ſin either by the deuill, world, or fleſh, that ſatan may be chained vp, &amp; not let looſe againſt vs, that the fleſh may bee nouriſhed, and not continue ſo rebellious in the euill motions thereof, and that we may auoide the outward flattering obiects in the world, and company of wicked men alluring vnto ſinne. Againſt which things, ſeeing that we pray, what mock gods are thoſe, that are careles of offering themſelues into temptations, and prouocations to ſinne? yea, delight ſo to doe, by frequenting wicked company, and giuing aduantage to Satan, whilſt they <pb n="484" facs="tcp:767:259"/> pleaſe themſelues in deceitefull obiects of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee pray againſt ſinne, euen when we are moſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tempted vnto it, becauſe it cannot be, but wee uſt needes meet with temptations, as long as we haue eyes, and hearts, and eares in this world. Wee pray therefore, that though we be tempted, yet wee may not be ouercome, and made ſlaues to ſinne, as they are, which commit ſinne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle to the Romans;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.16.</note>
                  <hi>He that committeth a ſinne, is the ſeruant of ſinne.</hi> To be preſerued from ſinne, vſe theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, with thy eies euer behold God preſent, with thy eares euer heare that terrible voyce ſounding, Ariſe yee dead, and come to iudgement, with thy hands bee euer exerciſing that which is good, in thy heart, euer hide the Word of God, and with thy feet ſtand in the courts of Gods houſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Againſt grieuous afflictions long continuing to make vs deſpaire of Gods mercy, or hearing our prayers: for theſe are the moſt forcible temptations in the world, and therefore need of ſtrong faith is there, ſtill to truſt in God, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to indure, that they may be turned of temptations to ſin, into purgations of ſin, that grace may more abound through meanes of them. And otherwiſe wee doe not pray againſt them, leaſt we ſhould be found ſuch, as would follow Chriſt, but whilſt we reſiſt the croſſe, rather goe from him, then take vp the croſſe and follow him, as he hath commanded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We pray againſt ſudden death, which is a great euill, and therfore threatned againſt wicked worldlings, of whom
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">Pſalm. 73.19.</note> 
                  <hi>How ſuddenly are they periſhed, deſtroyed, and horribly conſumed:</hi> yet we do not ſimply pray againſt ſudden death, out of a carnal deſire of licentiouſnes, but that we may haue ſpace to ſet our houſe in order, to teſtifie our faith to the comfort of the Church, and to repent of our renued treſpaſſes, into which we daily fall, though we ſtriue againſt them. The fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in the wilderneſſe deſtroyed the Iſraelites ſuddenly, and ſo did the Angell ſuddenly in one night deſtroy 185000. of the Aſſyrians, and all this was done in anger for ſinne: likewiſe the men of Bethſhemeſh periſhed, and <hi>

On the contrary ſide, it is a fauour vſually done to ſuch, <pb n="485" facs="tcp:767:259"/> as feare God, to giue them time at their death, as to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and to all, whoſe deaths are deſcribed. Which I ſpeake not as cenſuring thoſe, that die ſuddenly, but thoſe that find fault with praying againſt this vncomfortable departure. For whatſoeuer is ordinarily a ſigne of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and barreth his ordinary manifeſtation of his greateſt loue in this life is to bee prayed againſt: but ſuch is ſudden death, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is to be prayed againſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wee pray againſt obduration, and hardning in ſinne, through a cuſtome of ſinning, or through ſome notorious ſins, for which the Lord vſually giueth men ouer to ſinne, with a reprobate mind for a puniſhment, as he did the Gentiles, of whom the Apoſtle teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.

If any ſet light by ſuch a puniſhment, let him know, that hee is blinded by the god of this world, and led as the Aramites by
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> into the midſt of deuils in the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We pray againſt eternal death and damnation, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euill of all other, in regard of which, all torments here are but flea-bites, and to be deſpiſed.

Stedfaſtnes of faith, whereby as by a ſhield, the fiery darts of the Deuill are repreſſed and kept from hurting vs, which alſo is of vertue to purifie the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Patience in bearing any croſſe or affliction, whereby wee are tempted at any time, that in ſtead of ſinne, the iſſue thereof may bee hope, according to that of <hi>Paul, Tribulation bringeth forth patience,</hi>

                  <hi>Wee know that all things worke together for the beſt of thoſe that loue God, that are called of his purpoſe.</hi> That in the middeſt of temptation wee may haue the comfort of the Apoſtle, vnto whom, praying againſt temptations, it was anſwered; <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.10.</note> 
                  <hi>for my power is made perfect through weakeneſſe</hi> For though wee be tempted, and euill be intended againſt vs; yet the Lord, who can raiſe light out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, can turne this very euill into good vnto vs, whether it bee diſtraction of mind, ſickneſſe of body, priuation of any member, or ſinne it ſelfe. And this he doth:</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.71. </note>Thirdly, by framing to more carefull obedience for the time to come, as <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth; <hi>Jt is good for me that I haue been afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes:</hi> euen as ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that haue been beaten for their faults, or ſpent their <pb n="487" facs="tcp:767:260"/> time paſſed negligently, are afterwards the more carefull and induſtrious.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11 28. </note>Fourthly, euill is turned to our good by preuention, the Lord puniſhing vs in this world, that wee may eſcape in the world to come, as the Apoſtle teacheth to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We pray for euerlaſting life, that God for his mercies ſake would beſtow this good of all goods vpon vs, in regard of which, all the things of this world are but as a meſſe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as droſſe, and dung:<note place="margin">Heb. 12 16.

               <p n="3">3. The thankſgiuing is for Gods ſpirit of grace, making vs in any meaſure to reſiſt ſinne, and purging vs thereof, for the good ariſing to vs by temptations, for deliuerance from the puniſhments by our ſinnes deſerued, and for part giuen vs in the inheritance immortall and moſt glorious.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 130. Wherefore ſerueth the Concluſion, For thine is the Kingdome, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>It is added as a reaſon of all the Petitions to ſtrengthen our faith, that God being both able and willing doth grant all our requeſts made vnto him in the name of Chriſt, and therefore in the end we put to a note of confidence, and ſay, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Explan.</hi> Here we haue alſo to be obſerued the order, the ſenſe, and the ſcope of this concluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the order, it followeth all the Petitions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth <pb n="488" facs="tcp:767:261"/> a kind of promiſe to giue glory to God, and to bee thankfull, our requeſts being granted; whence wee learne, that it is neceſſary to obſerue the Lords dealing towards vs, when wee haue called vpon his name, how graciouſly he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and helpeth vs, that out of a ſpeciall apprehenſion of his former mercies, wee may build aſſured confidence of future, and be duely thankfull to his holy name. Thus
<hi>Dauid</hi> kept a Regiſter of the Lords dealing towards him, and is confident againſt the Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> and for thankfulneſſe it is required as much as prayer.<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Call vpon me in the time of trouble, and I will heare and deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me:</hi> thou ſhalt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this as thy duty, hauing receiued deliuerance, to note it, and to be thankfull. <hi>Pray continually and in all things giue thanks:</hi> thus did <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Deborah, Barak, Samſon,</hi> and all the faithfull. The not obſeruing of Gods mercies granted at our requeſt, blunts the edge of our zeale this way, and cauſeth, that the Lord hath none but a formall thankſgiuing at our hands, which is abominable: it maketh vs without confidence and feruency, triuiall and idle in our prayers, euen as an idiote or ſenſeles man, that hath not reaſon to know, note, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his benefactors, and ſuch as doe for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſenſe of the words. <hi>Thine is the Kingdome,</hi> that is both generall ouer the world, and ſpeciall ouer the Church and choſen, neither is there any kingdome, but is ruled by thee, as by the ſupreme conſtitutor, and appointer thereof, and in this faith doe we pray vnto thee, ſubmitting our ſelues, as thy ſubiects and liege people.
<hi>The power;</hi> that is, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, whereby thou art able to doe all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thy people aske and beg of thee, there is nothing out of thy power, neither life nor death, things preſent, nor things to come, no power can withſtand thee, either of men or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, but thou art able to doe for vs, mauger them all; wee are without all power and might in our ſelues to help our ſelues, wee know not what to doe, but our eyes wait vpon thee.
<hi>And the glory:</hi> that is, thou doeſt ſo moderate thy Kingdome and power, doing good to all thy people, that thou art the moſt glorious King, and moſt excellent, not ſtrange to thy ſubiects ſuing vnto thee, but louing and ready to accept of them, and <pb n="489" facs="tcp:767:261"/> to grant their ſuites, thou ſhalt make thy glory to ſhine more and more by being beneficiall vnto vs, thy faith and religion ſhall bee more eſteemed and reuerenced, and this will bee the end of all that thou doeſt for vs, thine eternall praiſe; yea, we giue thee glory in confidence of thy goodnes, &amp; promiſe due thankfulneſſe, and intend this in our deſires aboue all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amen:</hi> wee verily belieue that it ſhall bee ſo, and againe, with all feruency begge, O Lord let it bee ſo; wherefore let vs not bee deceiued of our hope, but do thou ſubſcribe to our deſires, and ſay, So be it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the ſcope,<note place="margin">The reaſons c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntained in the concluſion.</note> it containeth ſundry moſt ſtrong reaſons for the propping of our faith and aſſurance in our prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. </note>Firſt, from the Kingdome of God. A good King, louing and kind to his ſubiects, is eaſie to be intreated of them, and is delighted with their life and welfare: but thou art the beſt King of all; we thy ſubiects who do craue nothing but things needfull for vs, and tending to our welfare: therefore thou wilt be intreated. And the ſtrength of the reaſon lyeth in the firſt part, that a good King tendreth the good of his people, which wee ſhall find to bee true in all good Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who deſired, when the plague raged amongſt his people. <hi>Let thy hand, Lord, bee againſt mee, and againſt my fathers houſe, theſe ſheepe what haue they done?</hi> And in
<hi>Samuel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnkindly reiected by the people; yet being in their danger, deſired to pray for them: <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith hee,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that I ſhould ſinne againſt the Lord, and ceaſe praying for you.</hi> Yea, ſome Heathen Kings haue excelled herein, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian,</hi> who was ſo delighted in doing good vnto his people, as that if hee had let ſlippe any day, without doing ſome ſpeciall good for ſome man he would ſay, <hi>O ſocii, per didimus diem, O fellowes, wee haue loſt a day.</hi> This diſpoſition therefore to doe good, muſt needes bee much more in the beſt King of Kings at all times.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the power of God wee haue this reaſon. A King that wanteth no power to doe good vnto his ſubiects, if he be good, will aſſuredly doe for them in all their neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but thou, O Lord, art ſuch a powerfull King, nothing can hinder, or reſiſt thy good pleaſure. Therefore thou wilt <pb n="490" facs="tcp:767:262"/> doe theſe things for vs. Euery part of this reaſon is euident, for nothing but ability can hinder a mercifull Lord from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his humble ſeruants, hee being <hi>Parens patriae, the father of the country,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and a father, being ſo ready as the Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to doe good vnto his children when they aske of him: and as for this King, his power is infinite, he doth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleaſeth him in heauen and earth; hee is all-ſufficient to defend <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſtrange countries, <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Padam Aram, Dauid</hi> in the wilderneſſe, and <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whales belly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may build aſſured confidence of his mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm 19. </note>Thirdly, from the glory of God we haue this reaſon. Hee that being a great King regarding his glory aboue al things, will readily doe whatſoeuer may redound to his honour and glory: but thou (O God) art thus regardfull of thy glory, it being aboue all things tendred by thee: therefore wee doubt not but thou wilt grant theſe things, of which thou ſhalt haue ſo much glory. The ſtrength of this reaſon lieth in the ſecond part, that God doth principally regard his glory, and that by granting our requeſts, hee ſhall haue glory. The firſt is plaine, both by the moſt excellent workes of creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption &amp;c. which ſerue to manifeſt his glory, according to that of the Pſalmiſt.
<hi>The heauens declare the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> and according to that of the Apoſtle, who ſpeaking of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and redemption,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.6.</note> ſaith, that it was, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> And it is plaine alſo by his dealings, honoring ſuch as honour him, and bringing downe ſuch as take honour to themſelues, that hee onely may bee exalted in that day. Againe, that God hath glory by granting our requeſts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; for that our firſt and chiefe requeſt is, that God may bee glorified, and our deſire is, by being heard in all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, to haue matter of prayſing and magnifying his holy name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from the eternity of theſe things, for euer and euer, wee may reaſon thus. A moſt glorious and excellent King, out of whoſe power nothing is, who remaineth ſuch for euer, is euer alike graciouſly diſpoſed to his ſubiects: but God is a moſt glorious King and powerfull for euer, in all times and ages alike, and hath heretofore heard the requeſts <pb n="491" facs="tcp:767:262"/> of ſuch as faithfully haue called vpon his name: therefore he is ſtill likewiſe ready to do for vs, granting all our petitions. The firſt part of this reaſon is plaine, becauſe that he to whom no change is incident, the caſe being alwaies alike, cannot be changeable in his grace and fauour. The ſecond part is alſo euident, for God is hee
<note place="margin">Reuel. 1.8. Heb. 13.8.</note>
                  <hi>which is, which was, and which is to come; yea Ieſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday and to day, and for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his grace in times paſt, and readines to heare the prayers of ſuch as haue faithfully called vpon him, no age hath been without large teſtimony. <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and was heard, ſo that of a man naked and deſtitute, hee was made rich, and had great droues of cattell. <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> prayed, and had victory ouer his enemies, when he knew not what to doe; ſundry diſeaſed, poſſeſſed and blind perſons both in body and ſoule prayed, and were healed, and had their ſinnes pardoned, wherefore wee need not to doubt, but that we alſo are heard in our deſires.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, from our confidence, expreſſed in the laſt word
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> we may reaſon thus. The Lord will grant vnto vs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we belieue ſhall be granted, when we aske: but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue when we aske theſe Petitions; for we ſay <hi>Amen</hi> in hart, verily wee are perſwaded that it ſhall bee ſo; therfore they are granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Marke 9.23. </note>The firſt part of this reaſon, it is the ſaying of our Lord, <hi>Whatſoeuer yee aske if yee belieue, it ſhall bee done vnto you:</hi> for the ſecond, if wee diſſemble not, but haue our heart going with our tongue, wee doe belieue, and therefore are the more confident to ſpeed of our deſires.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially of theſe reaſons, The firſt hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſecond Petition, the ſecond to the third, the third to the firſt, the fourth to the fourth and fift, the fift to the laſt Petition. From hence ariſe theſe two concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they which learne aright to pray are moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleſſed, they build good ſpeed and ſucceſſe in all their deſignes vpon the ſureſt foundation in the world, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, glory, eternity and fidelity of the Lord: and therefore, as theſe ſhall not faile, ſo ſhall not their labours in <pb n="492" facs="tcp:767:263" rendition="simple:additions"/> prayer and ſupplication. In any attempt without this there is none aſſurance; the builder, watch-man, ſeedſ-man, build, watch, and caſt ſeede vpon the ground in vaine, in vaine are barnes pulled downe, and made greater, and fruits and goods heaped vp without profit, only he that maketh faithfull prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth it not in vaine. Let euery man then apply himſelfe to this exerciſe, and learne to doe it aright, by the peruſing and due conſideration of theſe, and the like meditations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the firſt beginning of all things is from God, ſo their end alſo is in him, to ſet forth his Kingdome, power, and glorie for euer, and therefore it ſhall bee our wiſedome in all things alwaies to reſpect God, to come to him, to walke with him, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; and with <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay in all things, <hi>Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but vnto thy name we giue the glory.</hi> If we aime at any other thing, we ſhall be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if wee go from God, and haue not him in our waies, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or not, we ſhall be brought vnto him; hills and mountaines laid vpon vs, ſhall not couer vs, but we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure his angry preſence, and as from a moſt ſeuere Iudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our iuſt doome:
<hi>Goe yee curſed into hell fire prepared for the Deuill and his Angels,</hi> and euen by this will he haue glory.</p>

Prayer indeed giueth wings to the ſoule, and maketh it mount vp to heauen, and there conuerſe, as in a glorious Citie, but not ſo knowne and familiar to vs by natiue acquaintance: but the Sacraments bring heauen downe to vs here on earth, and repreſent vnto vs more dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically ſpirituall graces, cloathed in tractable elements. In prayer we ſee God, yet at a diſtance, and through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue glaſſe of faith: but in the Sacraments we handle him, as it were immediately, yet ſo, that our outward ſenſes tarrie not at home, as dull ſchollers in the ſchoole of nature only, but trauell vp to the higheſt mount of ſpirituall meditation, and therein the language of faith (the true Teach-man of the Chriſtian ſoule) haue enter-courſe with that, which naturall elements cannot reach vnto, but as they are eleuated by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall ſignification. O the vnſpeakable goodnes of our God, who vouchſafeth thus to draw vs to him by the cords of man, and to ſtoope downe to vs in conuerſation, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating himſelfe vnder the habit of externall Sacraments. It was not enough for him to make a couenant with the ſoule of man vpon ſpirituall conditions, but he would alſo giue our bodily ſences a part to act, and an obiect to worke vpon. The bleſſed and bleſsing Couenant of grace made with vs in the Charter of the Goſpell, hath the broad ſeale of Heauen ſet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for the more ſenſible confirmation.

For we do not with the Church of Rome, hold for Sacraments, properly ſo called, thoſe rites and inſtitutions which are pecular to ſome kind of people on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as aforeſaid: but that theſe only are properly Sacraments which doe generally belong to all, and alſo without which there is (now vnder the Goſpel, no ſaluation ordinarily to be attained.

                  <hi>ſhall be damned:</hi> hee ſaith not, he that is not baptized, ſhall be damned: for ſometimes a man may neceſſarily be preuented by death, as many infants are, and ſometime through the delay of Parents without any
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:767:265" rendition="simple:additions"/> fault on their part, for which God forbid that wee ſhould iudge them out of the caſe of ſaluation. It is indeed a ſinfull neglect in Parents, (conſidering this to bee the onely ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to ſaluation) to hazard their children of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation hereof, and therefore well is it prouided, that all carefull diligence ſhould be vſed about it, eſpecially where there appeareth to bee danger of death in the childe, and I doubt not but all good Chriſtian people that ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to goe the ordinary way to heauen which God hath appointed, will vſe this diligence, as for others that wil finde out a new way, God bee mercifull vnto them.

                  <hi>Explan.</hi> After the number of Sacraments, about which there is moſt controuerſie, the definition of a Sacrament followeth, ſetting forth the nature of it. <hi>Jt is an outward viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne, &amp;c.</hi> This is common to all Sacraments, to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the Paſſeouer, and to ſuch as in more large ſenſe are called Sacraments, as to Marriage and all Legall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the brazen Serpent, the Rocke flowing out waters, and the red Sea diuided, for in them all is the outward ſigne, and an inward inuiſible grace ſet forth heereby.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ordained by Chriſt,</hi> this is the difference betwixt all other Sacraments and theſe of the new Teſtament, ſome were ordained by the mediation of men, as all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were in the Church vnder the Law, ſome for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſes ordained, and great graces vnder them ſignified, as Matrimony, the annointing of the ſicke for a time; and ſome were ordained Sacraments by Chriſt, purpoſely to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and confirme the maine grace vnto vs, and theſe are Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord.</p>

               <p>

But if any ſuch corruption bee, the perſon being faithfull that receiueth the Sacrament, and ignorant how the wine is mixed, or in his infancie how the water hath beene blended, it ſhall ſtand in force vnto him, if the right forme of the inſtitution hath beene vſed, in baptiſme, in the name of the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; in the Lords Supper. <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe it it is Gods pledge, though ſome things be ouer added.</p>
               <p>Againe, make a change of the outward ſigne into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, and it ceaſeth to be a Sacrament, as by that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Tranſubſtantiation in the Lords Supper: for if the ſigne be changed into the thing ſignified, that is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no more than an Angel in gold is a pledge for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Angell.</p>

And it were indeed a prepoſtrous courſe, for a man of yeares and vnderſtanding, to be baptized before repentance, as before couenants made for a maiſter to giue his cognizance, to retaine any into his ſeruice, or to ſeale him a leaſe or grant of any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome duty or ſeruice done.

               <p>Another hath noted, 1. that they teach it to be auaileable, as for the liuing, ſo for the dead: 2. to be carried about the Church: 3. to be carried about the ſtreets: 4. to be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fields, that the corne and graſſe may grow: 5. to be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wars for the obtaining of victory: 6. before the Pope when he goeth forth: 7. at the comming of Kings into cities: And which might more be added, to houſes on fire, and to waters ouerflowing, as <hi>Clement</hi> the fift caſt it into the Riuer

               <p>Thus do theſe men, as led with the ſpirit of lying, triflingly deale with this bleſſed Sacrament, and ſeeking too highly to extoll it, make their vſe of it vaine and ridiculous: and when as euery good Chriſtian ſhould follow his maſter Chriſt, they differ altogether from him He commanded, <hi>Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <pb n="531" facs="tcp:767:282"/> of me,</hi> they in remembrance of the dead. Chriſt tooke it, and gaue thankes, they breath vpon it. Chriſt brake it, they hang it vp in a pyxe: Chriſt gaue it to his Diſciples, they moſt commonly eate vp all alone, and ſo it is no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (properly ſo called) of the faithfull together; Chriſt took bread, and gaue bread; they take bread, and giue fleſh: Chriſt gaue it to confirme faith, they to redeeme departed ſoules: Chriſt gaue it to bee eaten, they to bee adored: Chriſt ſpake plainely in a knowne tongue, they in Latin, which is not by the vulgar vnderſtood. Not to aske them therefore (which is but loſt labour) what the benefit is, wee ſay, that it is the ſtrengthening and refreſhing of the ſoule. More diſtinctly, whatſoeuer benefit redoundeth to the corporall life from the Bread and Wine, the like redoundeth here-from to the worthy receiuer, by vertue of Chriſts body and bloud, as before hath been particularly declared.

               <p>Firſt, from the comparing of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> together, who ſeeme to ſpeake one againſt the other, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying, that wee are iuſtified by faith without the workes of the Law,
<hi>Iames,</hi> that we are iuſtified by workes, and not by faith onely, both bringing for example the father of the faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may reaſon thus:</p>
               <p>Such as was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, ſuch ought the faith of euery man to bee, that hee may bee iuſtified and ſaued: But
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> faith was a liuing faith, expreſsing it ſelf by the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Idolatrous Country, when God called him, and by ſacrificing his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> in admirable obedience, when God commanded, that is, by forſaking ſinne, though moſt deare, and performing obedience, euen in that which was hardeſt. Therefore ſuch muſt our faith alſo bee.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 28.13. </note>Secondly, faith that doth not thus liue, appeareth to bee vaine, becauſe it is a building without a foundation, the only foundation of faith being Gods promiſes, which belong not to any but ſuch as haue and do by true repentance turne from ſinne: For you ſhall find none other promiſe of God, but ſuch as this: <hi>Hee that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſinnes, ſhall haue mercy,</hi> and this:
<hi>Whenſoeuer a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinne from the bottome of his heart, I will put all his wickedneſſe out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi> Now ſuch as is the ground whereupon any mans faith is built, ſuch is his faith, if the ground be none, his faith is vaine, but the ground of his faith that continueth in ſinne without repentance is none, God hauing made no promiſe vnto him, therefore his faith is vaine. If hee ſhall ſay, but I meane to repent before my death: Ah ſtrange deluſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; thou art content then in the meane ſeaſon to be without faith, and without intereſt in the merits of Chriſt, to be vnder the dominion of the Deuill, and in a Reprobate eſtate.

                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:767:285"/>Thirdly, faith that is not liuing, is vaine, becauſe the true faith doth eſtabliſh the Law, but this diſannulleth it, ſeeing it looketh for ſaluation, and yet doth contrary to the Law by liuing in ſinne.</p>

               <p>Secondly, let the Communicant conſider of Gods admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue in vniting him ſo neare vnto his Sonne, and through his ſonne vnto himſelfe, and in feeding him from heauen with ſuch comforts, without which his ſoule muſt needs bee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſtarued, and periſh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Explan.</hi> The receiuing of the Lords Supper is not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient holy duty, as it is by moſt men vſed (who put ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe vpon them for the time, afterwards returning as the dogge to the vomit, and as the ſwine to the wallowing in the mire) but it is a ſealing of couenants betwixt God and his people, and the grace of God for the pardon of all our ſinnes; and our dutifulneſſe to God, in forſaking all our old ſinnes, and liuing according to his holy lawes: For as God doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giue himſelfe vnto vs to become our God, and gracious Father; ſo we giue our ſelues vnto God, to become his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and obedient children.</p>
               <p>There be theſe two parties in all couenants, otherwiſe they cannot ſtand, ſomething aſſured and giuen, and ſomething taken and receiued therefore: So betwixt Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; the Prince giueth and aſſureth his care in ruling, and prouiding well for the good of the Subiect, hee receiueth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <pb n="544" facs="tcp:767:289"/> cuſtome and obedience: ſo betwixt maſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, betwixt ſellers and buyers, lenders and borrowers.</p>

            <p>Anſw. <hi>The antiquity of thoſe books, ſome of them being before all other bookes ſundry times oppugned, and ſought to be burnt vp by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and yet wonderfully preſerued, and by miracles from heauen confirmed, is a manifest proofe, that they came from heauen, and are not of mans inuention.</hi>

                  </gap>oly Scriptures are Gods word. </note>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> Amongſt all arguments there is none of that force in the conſcience of man; that this is of being taken from the diuinitie of the holy Scriptures. For let it appeare that they are of God, and what heart dares doe any other but yeeld vnto them? Now, that they are of God, may bee plainely prooued by ſundry reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:767:291"/>Firſt, by their Antiquitie; for the firſt and moſt ancient writings in the world concerning Religion, muſt needs be Gods, but theſe are the firſt and moſt ancient; therefore muſt needs be Gods.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the moſt ancient are Gods Scriptures, is plaine; becauſe otherwiſe either ſome other Inſtructor muſt haue beene before God: or elſe God, the Ruler of the whole world, muſt haue beene without any thing recorded, whereby the world ought to be ruled, till that man had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented ſomething to gouerne man by; both which are moſt abſurd.</p>
            <p>That the holy Scriptures are moſt ancient, appeareth by the moſt ancient humane writers. <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the firſt of all, writeth of the two Tables deliuered to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whence he ſaith, that he learned what he knew of God. <hi>Linus</hi> wrote of the Tower of Babylon deſcribed by <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> making plaine heereby that the Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> were long before any of their writings, and ſo the moſt ancient in the world. Hence it is that <hi>Tacianus</hi> affirmeth that it appeareth out of <hi>Beroſus</hi> a <hi>Caldee</hi> Writer,<note place="margin">Tatiani Oratio aduerſus gentes, Moſes fuit Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho antiquior &amp; plurimis diis gentium <hi>Clem. Alexandr.</hi>
               </note> out of the writings of the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians and Annales of the Egyptians, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote long before <hi>Orpheus, Linus, Amphyon, Homer,</hi> or the moſt ancient Ethnickes. Now the Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole Scriptures, all that followeth tending one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the further explanation heereof. Wherefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are moſt auncient, and conſequently the vndoubted word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is further prooued by the preſeruation of the Scriptures in all ages, other ancient Bookes being periſhed either in part or in whole, but the holy Scriptures, though more oppugned then any by perſecutors, who haue ſought to blot out the memory of them, yet are wholly preſerued without diminution or corruption of any part of them. Had they beene of man, certainly it would haue happened vnto them as vnto many other humane writings, which are moſt ancient: which, if they haue not periſhed, yet they haue been falſified: yea, one complaineth, that hee himſelfe yet

               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleuerunt. The Brethren requeſting I wrote Epiſtles, theſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Deuill haue filled with tares, adding ſome things, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away otherſome.</hi> Now the holy Scriptures haue been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly preſerued heerein, in the hands of the Iewes, who haue miſliked ſome things, and forbidden them to be read, as <hi>Daniel,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo plainly of the Meſsiah: in the hands of the heathen, as when at the requeſt of <hi>Ptolomee</hi> they were tranſlated by the Septuagint, and in the hands of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, who haue corrupted Fathers and Councels, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer durſt, but haue beene reſtrained from heauen, from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is further proued by the miracles which haue been wrought to confirme the Scriptures to be of God, the Author of all true miracles: of this ſort are the miracles wought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Prophets, by Chriſt, and by his Diſciples. For all theſe miracles doe plainly teſtifie of them, that they were ſent of God; and if they were of God, then the word by them ſet forth is the word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſame is proued by the propheſies contained in the Scriptures, ſome being of things to come to paſſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeares after, as that the ſeed of the woman ſhould breake the ſerpents head, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity ſhould be numberleſſe, that they ſhould be ſtrangers 400. yeares, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſhould burne the bones of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did ſacrifice, that the people of Iſrael ſhould be in captiuity 70. yeares, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> expreſſely forenamed, ſhould giue them leaue to returne and diuerſly honour them, &amp;c. From hence we may reaſon thus: Thoſe Scriptures which in their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations exceed all the vnderſtanding of all creatures, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly his who is aboue all creatures, that is Gods: but ſuch are the holy Scriptures, as appeareth by theſe &amp; the like Propheſies.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. for no created vnderſtanding can of it ſelfe reach to things to come, to ſay certainly thus it ſhal be: ſome may coniecture, or being appointed as inſtruments of execution may declare what themſelues ſhall performe, as <pb n="550" facs="tcp:767:292"/> the Deuill did to <hi>Saul,</hi> but God onely hath made it ſo proper to himſelfe to foretell independently, abſolutely, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what ſhall come afterwards, as that it may well be ſaid, <hi>Let them tell what ſhall come, let them doe good or euill, and ſay that they be Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame is further proued by the Argument handled in the Scriptures, which is altogether graue &amp; holy, tending to the ſetting forth of all vertue, and againſt all vice, wheras (as <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> hath obſerued) the writers of the Heathen gods and religion,<note place="margin">Iuſtin Martyr.</note> were either ridiculous Poets, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue the beginning of all from the waters, &amp; handle the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and filthy loues of the gods: or Phyloſophers more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: for that the very chiefe of them were vncertaine of the beginning of things. Now ſuch as the writing is, ſuch muſt needs be the Author from whom it firſt commeth; true it is, that he which is vnholy may write things holy &amp; good, but then they come not from him, but firſt from ſome other fountaine: therefore the moſt holy, who is God, muſt needs be the Author of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is proued by the teſtimony of Heathen men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt Images, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the chiefe religious Emperour amongſt the heathen Romans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of. <hi>Numenius</hi> a <hi>Pythagorean;</hi> Phyloſopher ſaith of <hi>Plato,</hi> that hee was none other but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking in the Atticke tongue.<note place="margin">Euſeb. de prepar.

Verily, from Gods prouidence, that no man might deny that, which by the light of nature is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged of naturall man, <hi>viz</hi> the truth and Diuinitie of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſame is proued by the ſingle drift of the Scriptures, which is only, to giue all glory to God, nothing to man, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the faults of the beſt are ingenuouſly and without flattery ſet downe; neither is any mans fauour affected or ſought for in any of theſe books, which cannot be ſaid of any humane writings.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſame is proued by the conſent of all the books of holy Scripture, though written by diuers men at ſundry times. Neuer was the like to be found touching mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but euen the ſame Author hath been oftentimes noted to differ from himſelfe. Wherefore the Writers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures were vndoubtedly guided by one ſpirit of truth, and what they wrote came from this ſpirit which is God. If any differences ſeeme to be in theſe holy writings, this is, through the weakneſſe of our conceit and miſvnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not indeed.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 147. Hauing this Word of God written, is it not ſufficient for our ſaluation without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, euen as to haue a Booke of Statutes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to be kept from the danger of the Law, to thoſe that will?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>It is not ſufficient, but it muſt alſo bee ſet forth by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that the hard places may bee rightly vnderstood, wee may bee kept from errours, and haue our dull hearts ſtirred vp to imbrace the holy precepts hereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> Many there be who acknowledge the Scriptures to be Gods word; but doe not ſo much regard the preaching <pb n="552" facs="tcp:767:293"/> of this word, proſuming vpon their owne ability, to make a good vſe of it in priuat by reading, for their edification, and ſaluation. And ſome colour of reaſon there is alſo for this, ſeeing that the word ſerueth to acquaint vs with the wil and law of God, as a ſtatute booke, with the Lawes of the land; and knowing theſe Lawes, if we will not obey, all preaching cannot bring vs to obedience, or doe vs more good. But this is a deceitfull colour. Firſt, becauſe a Statute book is not like vnto Gods booke, that being humane, and the penalty ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this diuine and ſpirituall; and not vnderſtood by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: ſo that a man may read much here, but remain ſtill as deſtitute of vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Actes
8.</note> as the Eunuch who asked, <hi>How can I vnderſtand without an Interpreter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe preaching is the meane by which God hath wrought in all ages, and will principally and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully worke by this ordinarily for our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.18. 1 Pet. 2, 2. </note>Thirdly, becauſe no man can receiue the word to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, vnleſſe he reuerence and eſteeme of the preaching ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing that the word it ſelfe doth ſo highly commend and vrge to attend to preaching.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe the Lord, who onely can giue light by his word, doth direct ſuch as be in darknes, to the Preachers of his word,
<hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> the
<hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip &amp;c.</hi> refuſing otherwiſe to giue them any light.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe men are naturally dull and backward to that which is good, when they know it, ſo that reading only they are ſtill frozen in their ſins: it is neceſſary, that by the exhortation of preaching they ſhould bee ſtirred vp, and by the zeale and heat of others bee warmed and become agile and chearefull to doe accordingly.</p>
            <p>In all things wee ſay for comfort, <hi>Two are better then one:</hi> and why ſhould it not be ſo in this alſo? A man reading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is forgetfull, and letteth it flip ſoone out of his mind which he readeth: a faithfull Miniſter of Gods word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him, and bringeth continually to his remembrance; hee is like a ſticke lying by a firebrand ready to goe out; the Miniſter ſtirres vp the fire, and layes the ſtickes together, he
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:767:293"/> hath bread by him, but is feeble, becauſe he cannot breake it in pieces to eate ſome of it, the Miniſter breakes it vnto him for his comfort.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that it is neceſſary to exerciſe the hearing of this Word preached, beſides the priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, and hee that hauing the meanes, contemneth them, wandreth ſtill in ſinne and blindneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 148. What is the preaching of the Word of God?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>It is properly the expounding of ſome part thereof, the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence the duties to be followed, and the ſinnes to be auoided, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to doe accordingly.</hi>

               <hi>Explan.</hi> Some there be, that moue as much trouble about preaching, as others that deny the neceſsity hereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues onely with reading: ſome affirming the bare reading of the Scriptures to be preaching; ſome talking here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one neighbour to another, and ſome the reading of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or Sermons. But the preaching of the word to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is more then all theſe, as may appeare both by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the dayes of
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when it is ſaid, that the Prieſt ſtood vpon a place higher then the people, <hi>and read the Law of God plainely, and expounding the ſence gaue the vnderſtanding of the Scriptures.</hi> And alſo in the new Teſtament, where after the Lecture of the Law and the Prophets, it is ſaid, that the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogue ſent to <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe with him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Act. 13 15.</note> 
               <hi>Men and brethren if there be in you any word of exhortation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, ſpeake.</hi> From hence ariſeth plainelie this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Preaching, to be <hi>an expounding, &amp;c.</hi> as in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
            <p>Now for reading the Scriptures (though in a large ſenſe it be a kind of preaching, becauſe that the truth is hereby ſet forth, and the Goſpell, and meanes of ſaluation made known to him that readeth, or heareth it read; yet it is properly no more preaching, then reading is an Oration; neither is hee that doth thus any more a Preacher, then ſuch an one, an Oratour. For when the queſtion is made, whether reading <pb n="554" facs="tcp:767:294"/> be preaching? it is not meant, whether by reading is not the truth ſet forth, and may not ſauing grace be wrought in the hearers? but whether reading bee the preaching practiſed by the Miniſters of Gods word vnder the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which is ſo much commended for the liuely opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being Gods ſpecial and greateſt ordinary power to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; and whether the reading bee that which wee haue charge to intend, when we are bidden, go preach the Goſpel? For vnleſſe they ſtriue to make their reading ſuch a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they queſtion about nothing, if to make it ſuch a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching they ſtriue againſt the ſtreame, the whole current of examples recorded in the Word, being againſt them: yea, that ſpeciall place, which they think a moſt ſure ground for them. <hi>Moſes hath of old ſuch as preach him, when he is read in their Synagogues euery Sabbath day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15.26.</note> doth plainely rebuke their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſeeing that it may well be hence gathered, that at all times vpon the Sabbath, when the Prieſts read <hi>Moſes,</hi> they expounded and gaue light vnto the people by teaching, as in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> daies. Much more might bee ſaid for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute of ſuch groſſe opinions; but becauſe I propounded to bee briefe in all things, thus much ſhall ſuffice briefly for this.</p>
            <p>Let vs all lay aſide partiality, whereby wee are carried to fauour our ſelues, and ſeeke our owne eaſe, and this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fountaine of ſuch troubled opinions being dammed vp, I doubt not but wee ſhall with one conſent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to preach in another manner, then by reading and familiar talking, applying our ſelues to the right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures, that we may giue the right ſenſe, after the ſenſe, find out ſound and profitable doctrines, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good reaſon, conuincing the iudgement, and after the doctrines, frame ſome forcible exhortations, to bring and bow the affections to the light ſet vp in the vnderſtanding, that Gods people may haue more grace, and his holy name more glorie.</p>

Thou haſt led vs to thy houſe, thou haſt ſet thy doore open vnto vs, thou haſt heard our prayers and ſupplications made for our ſelues, and for the reſt of thy Church Militant vpon earth: ſuffer them not (O Lord) to returne empty vnto vs, though comming from polluted lips, and hearts full of many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Receiue them as ſweetned with the precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of thy Son our Sauiours paſsion, and perpetuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion. Thou haſt fed vs there with Manna from heauen, by
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:767:302"/> the miniſtry of thy holy word: thou haſt vouchſafed thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence vnto vs, filling vs with ioy &amp; gladnes, thou haſt giuen vs to belieue, to abhor ſinne, and imbrace thy grace, though we are aſhamed of our inconſtancy, and too little profiting, in regard of the meanes of ſo long a time. O Lord, ſuffer not this to bee as an vntimely birth in vs, or as the graſſe vpon the houſe top, that neuer commeth to perfection, but worke in vs conſtancy and perſeuerance, that where any grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, it may be continued and perfited in the day of the Lord, and where it is not begun, it may be in thy good time. Open our eyes ſtill more and more to ſee thoſe things, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the peace and welfare of our ſoules, that wee may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fow after them. Giue vs grace to conſider the vanity of this world, and of all worldly things, and that the whole duty of man is to feare God and to keepe his commandements, and encline our hearts vnto theſe, and not vnto couetouſnes. Let vs not be forgetfull hearers of thy Word, but carefull doers of thy will; let thy Word dwell plenteouſly in vs, that as the Scepter of thy Kingdome it may ſway vs; as immortall ſeed, it may fructifie in vs; as a ſword, it may cut vp ſinne, and as a pillar of fire, it may guide vs in the night of this world, till we come to the heauenly Canaan. Forgiue the infirmities of this day, our irreuerence in thy worſhip, our vanity, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and neglect of ſo precious time. Let not theſe things hinder, but that thy word may become the ſweete ſauour of life vnto vs, but that we may be made hereby fruitfull in all good works, to the honour of thy moſt bleſſed name, through Ieſus Chriſt our onely Mediatour and Aduocate. Amen.</p>

               <head>A Prayer to be vſed in the time of ſicknes.</head>
               <p>MOſt gracious God, who onely ſmiteſt, and art able to heale againe, breakeſt, and art able to binde vp againe, behold with the eye of compaſsion mee thy poore ſeruant, iuſtly broken &amp; ſmitten with thy rod for my tranſgreſsions; behold, I ſay, how I lye at the gate of thy mercy, waiting till thy charitable hand bee ſtretched out to helpe, and comfort mee: I am a wretched ſinner, I confeſſe, O Lord, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <pb n="572" facs="tcp:767:303"/> puniſhment thou doeſt inflict vpon mee, I deſerue tenne thouſand times more at thy reuenging hands, if thou ſhouldſt enter into iudgement with me. In my proſperitie I haue waxed wanton, like a ful fed heifer, lifting vp my heele againſt thee; I haue giuen my ſtrength vnto ſinne, and not vnto thy ſeruice; and although thy word hath been ſounded in mine eares, threatning heauy puniſhments for my ſinnes, yet I flattered my ſelfe in my heart, ſaying, I ſhall neuer bee moued. But haue mercy vpon mee, moſt mercifull Father, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, remember not theſe my abuſings of thy mercies againſt mee, but let there bee an healing of my tranſgreſsions and ſins. Open mine eyes to ſee how greatly I haue offended, in omitting duties commanded, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euils forbidden againſt thee, and againſt my brethren, that all my ſorrow may be turned into ſorrow for ſinne, that the iſſue hereof may bee repentance vnto ſaluation, neuer to be repented of. And (good Father) bee pleaſed vpon my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained humiliation, and turning vnto thee, in mercy to turne vnto me againe, ſpeaking peace vnto my mourning ſoule, ſaying by thy ſpirit that I ſhall be comforted. And the cauſe of all miſery, ſinne, being remooued out of thy ſight, let my puniſhment be remoued alſo. Remember my frailty, O Lord, how that my ſtrength is not the ſtrength of ſtones, or of iron, that I be not tempted beyond that I ſhalbe inabled to beare. Temper my bitter cup with ſuch faith, patience, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as that I may wiſely, patiently, and with due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion drinke of the ſame, to thy glory, mine owne comfort, and the good example of others. When I am weakeſt, bee thou ſtrongeſt by thy grace in me, and let my prayers in the name of thy deare ſon preuaile, as the wreſtlings of <hi>Iacob,</hi> for a bleſsing in the middeſt of theſe grieuous troubles. Set the the glory of thy Saints before mine eyes alwaies, that I may the better beare theſe momentany afflictions, which are not to be compared vnto that ineſtimable ioy. Make me ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold the Lord Ieſus heauy vnto the death, wounded, bleeding and dying an accurſed death, when hee was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without fault or blame, that I may not bee deſpairingly caſt downe, ſeeing that I ſuffer iuſtly for my ſins. Giue me <pb n="573" facs="tcp:767:303"/> a due conſideration of thy wonderfull loue manifeſted in afflictions, to thy children, that I may reioyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing that I am puniſhed in this world for my amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I may eſcape the intollerable iudgements of the world to come. Turne mine eyes downward, to ſee how thy holieſt ſeruants, <hi>Iob, Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> with infinite others, haue more deeply taſted of this cup of aduerſitie, that I may not grieue to be ſorted with them, who are now in Paradiſe: with theſe &amp; the like heauenly meditations ſo fill my mind, O Lord, that I may beare my infirmities. And deferre not, but make haſt to worke my deliuerance, according to thy promiſe to thoſe that truſt in thee. I beleeue, O Lord, helpe mine vnbeliefe, let it not hinder the working of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, the freeing me out of this griefe and miſery. Once againe let mee haue ſome reſpit from my paine that I may praiſe thee in the land of the liuing, &amp; if through thy mercy I ſhall be reſtored to health and ſtrength, ſo ſanctifie this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as that I may ſay, it is good for me that I haue been afflicted, for that I am hereby taught to keepe thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. And here I doe promiſe and vow my ſelfe, O God vnto thee, if thou ſhalt vouchſafe this mercy, a perpetuall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in ſoule and body, to ſerue thee in new obedience for all time to come. If in thy diuine counſell thou haſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this to be the end of my fraile life here: O Lord into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, preſerue me to thy Kingdome, to the very laſt gaſpe; let not Sathan come neere vnto me, ſet a guard of thy holy Angels about me, and ſo aſsiſt me with thy grace, that both in life and in death, vnto the end and in the end, I may glorifie thee, that my troubles in my bed of ſickneſſe may end in perpetuall reſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and my grieuous pangs, in euerlaſting ioy, and heauenly ſinging to thee, O King, and to the Lambe that ſits vpon the throne, who with the holy Ghoſt euer liues and reignes one God world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
