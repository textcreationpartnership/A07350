            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Brethren, euer Å¿ince my firÅ¿t entring into a PaÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge, I haue applied mine endeauours, by Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿ing to inÅ¿truct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And becauÅ¿e I would not be irregular, my Theame hath alwaies been the Å¿hort CatechiÅ¿me, Å¿et forth in the Booke of Common Prayer, a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿me indeede, Å¿olely appointed to bee firÅ¿t taught; but to the great detriment of our Church either wholly neglected, any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred, or barely taught without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explanation, or elÅ¿e for outward formality onely in Lent Å¿et vpon the Table, as a diÅ¿h ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that FaÅ¿t. My Å¿tudy hath been <pb facs="tcp:767:3"/> firÅ¿t to mend this fault for my owne particular, and therefore I haue diuers yeares labored con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly throughout the yeare, by this kind of teaching to forme in my hearers Å¿ome diÅ¿tinct knowledge of our ChriÅ¿tian Principles: and hauing at length come to my intended period, I digeÅ¿ted the pith of all my Collections and Meditations into this Booke, herein imitating
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>rÅ¿inus</hi> vpon <hi>Melanctons</hi> Å¿hort CatechiÅ¿me, Å¿o vÅ¿efull to young Students in Theologie, and to other Å¿tudious perÅ¿ons. The labour thus ended, being conÅ¿cious to my Å¿elf of mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, I Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed it three or foure yeares, till that being animated by Å¿ome of you (my Brethren) who had either Å¿eene or heard hereof, I haue aduentured to bring it into publike view. The worke I confeÅ¿Å¿e is ordinary and worthles; but for forme it is alone, and Å¿o may craue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement. Heere are collected into one all fundamentall points, of the true ChriÅ¿tian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Å¿parÅ¿edlie handled in diuers learned Bookes, and applied to the Å¿hort EngliÅ¿h Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿me. It is a CatechiÅ¿me and a Comentarie, the one for Children, Å¿hort, and fitted to their capacity, the other for men, leading to a larger mappe of ChriÅ¿tian Principles, and fitted for <pb facs="tcp:767:3"/> the edification of all. To haue written a large new CatechiÅ¿me without an old text, had bin Å¿uperfluous amongÅ¿t Å¿o many already abroad, but to write for the illuÅ¿trating of the Text, to which we EngliÅ¿h muÅ¿t all hold vs, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary. In publiÅ¿hing this, I take not vpon me to preÅ¿cribe a forme vnto any, my Å¿elfe being the leaÅ¿t amongÅ¿t thouÅ¿ands, but I whet on all, what I can, to an vniforme proceeding by our common grounds. We haue all one God, one ChriÅ¿t, one BaptiÅ¿me, one GoÅ¿pell, and one forme of Articles of Religion, to which wee Å¿ubÅ¿cribe; why then Å¿hould we not all conÅ¿ent in one CatechiÅ¿me? Our Mother the Church of England, hath firÅ¿t commaunded this one CatechiÅ¿me, vpon which is my Commentary. If therefore my inward wiÅ¿hes may breake foorth into open requeÅ¿t, I would craue that it might pleaÅ¿e the right Reuerend Fathers of our Church, more Å¿trictly to preÅ¿Å¿e the teaching of our common CatechiÅ¿me in their Å¿euerall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿dictions: and you my Brethren, who doe already teach it in your Å¿euerall PariÅ¿hes, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it with all diligence, and to bring it in, and commend it to the priuate exerciÅ¿e of your people in their families, amongÅ¿t whom it <pb facs="tcp:767:4"/> hath hitherto been much neglected. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eech you all fauourably to accept this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent act, and where I haue faulted, correct me; where I haue failed, Å¿upply me; where I haue done rightly, ioyne with me. If this may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, though but goats hayre, towards the Lords Sanctuary, I Å¿hall be glad, and giue God the glory. Our great Shepheard, the Lord IeÅ¿us, who hath laid downe his life for his Å¿heepe, make this and all the endeauours of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, fruitfull paÅ¿tures for the comfort of his flocke, and for the praiÅ¿e of his holy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name.

            <p>This Primer QueÅ¿tion may bee called the way to the Church dore: it leadeth to the mention of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me, which is the gate of ChriÅ¿tianity. It is prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before our CatechiÅ¿me, as an Introduction, or familiar entrance, framed by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion and anÅ¿wer, for the inÅ¿truction of the Å¿impler: and therefore is not idle and vnfitting, as Å¿ome would haue it, but very agreeable to the matter intended. InaÅ¿much, as a ChriÅ¿tian mans name doth not onely diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h him from other men of different names; but alÅ¿o Å¿erueth for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, whereby the grace of God Å¿hould bee Å¿tirred vp in him. Thus the people had names of old: <hi>Adam,</hi> Å¿ignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="2" facs="tcp:767:17"/> red earth; <hi>Euah,</hi> a mother:
<hi>Abram,</hi> an high father: <hi>IÅ¿aac,</hi> laughing: <hi>Iacob,</hi> Å¿upplanting: and the Lord himÅ¿elfe hath a name preÅ¿cribed,
<hi>IeÅ¿us,</hi> a Sauiour, &amp;c. Neither were theÅ¿e names giuen by chance, but Almighty God himÅ¿elfe being the firÅ¿t guide hereunto, and many times appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the name, then holy men followed; and generally, all the world in former ages, gaue names of Å¿peciall Å¿ignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter called the Hebrew childe drawn out of the riuer,
<hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> Drawne-out. <hi>IoÅ¿eph</hi> was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King, <hi>Abres,</hi> Father; when, as a Father hee prouided for the Countrey, &amp;c. A more eÅ¿peciall day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monitory may this bee to vs, for that our name doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vnto vs our ChriÅ¿tian ProfeÅ¿sion, that wee may walke worthy of the Å¿ame. And this may Å¿erue for Å¿ome direction vnto vs, in the naming of our children, that wee preferre not heathen names where other are vÅ¿uall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16. </note>Thirdly, wee are to conÅ¿ider, what is the office which the God-fathers and God-mothers doe binde themÅ¿elues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the behalf of themÅ¿elues. Now as hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Å¿aid, neither men nor Angels can effect this work of grace, it is a worke proper to God alone. Wee are not therefore to Å¿uppoÅ¿e that their promiÅ¿e tendeth to the full performance of this, by themÅ¿elues, as vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or infuÅ¿ers of grace, but to doe what weake helpe and means may be able to do, both by their care of inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if parents be negligent or departed, &amp; alÅ¿o by prayer vnto God for them. Godfathers were of old taken for Å¿ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as when one is admitted to be apprentice to any trade hee muÅ¿t haue Å¿ureties for his truÅ¿ty and faithfull Å¿eruice: Å¿o was it thought fit, when men turned from heatheniÅ¿me, and were by baptiÅ¿me admitted into the order of ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that Å¿uch as were counted faithfull, Å¿hould be Å¿ureties for their conÅ¿tant and honeÅ¿t proceeding according to the Å¿ame order, and this was done when men were of age and able to anÅ¿wer for themÅ¿elues, and hath euer Å¿ince held to bee auailable to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e, and much more neceÅ¿Å¿ary for infants, when growing vp, they Å¿hall be pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <pb n="11" facs="tcp:767:21"/> vnto holineÅ¿Å¿e by them. O how greatly then are they to bee blamed, that turne this cuÅ¿tome into an idle cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by putting all care off: thus fruÅ¿trating the intent of the Church, and deluding the congregation of Gods people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly let vs take a briefe view, what be thoÅ¿e abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which a ChriÅ¿tian at his firÅ¿t oath of allegeance to God, is to abiure Å¿olemnly. They are the <hi>Diuell and his workes, the pompes and vanities of this wicked world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an expreÅ¿Å¿e forme of abrenunciation of the Diuell and the pompes of the world is very ancient, and may well be thought to haue bin deriued from the Primitiue Church; whereof we find expreÅ¿Å¿e mention in
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> and others. Very well therefore hath it beene continued in the Church of God, and retained in this our Mother Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. True it is, that though Å¿uch diÅ¿auowing were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed at BaptiÅ¿me, yet it muÅ¿t needes be included impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly in the very Å¿tipulation of that couenant, whereby we make our Å¿elues members of ChriÅ¿t: But it is a more liuely and firme monitory vnto vs, to hold vs in due alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to our Lord and Sauiour, when we record, that we haue at the firÅ¿t entring our names into his Band, and marching vnder his Banner, proclaimed an expreÅ¿Å¿e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and abiuration of all his enemies. WhileÅ¿t this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> Å¿ounds in our eares, how Å¿hall we dare to fly ouer like traytors to that enemie: nay, Å¿o much as to bee Å¿eene to maintaine correÅ¿pondence, or entertaine intelligence with thoÅ¿e that are profeÅ¿Å¿ed rebels againÅ¿t our Lord? I haue Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly before God and the congregation forÅ¿aken the Diuell and his workes, to cleaue vnto my Lord ChriÅ¿t, and to Å¿et my Å¿elfe about his holy worke. Shall I then put my hand, or heart to the workes of Sathan, of DarkeneÅ¿Å¿e, of Death? Sure if I doe the Diuels worke, he will pay me my wages, the wofull wages of Å¿inne; what that is; if mine owne conÅ¿cience did not Å¿ufficiently vpbraid me, the holy Å¿eruant of ChriÅ¿t St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth further tell me, <hi>The wages of Å¿inne is Death.</hi> I haue profeÅ¿Å¿edly renounced the vanities and pompes of this wicked world. Shall I then turne Å¿eruant to <pb n="12" facs="tcp:767:22"/> Å¿o empty and deceiuing a MaÅ¿ter, as is this wicked world? Sure if I doe, the reward of my Å¿inne will be in the end no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>anitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> ChriÅ¿t my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bought mee out of this wicked world: Å¿hall I Å¿ell my Å¿elfe againe to that tyrant, and that for nothing? Such profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Meditations are Å¿uggeÅ¿ted, by this couragious defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made in the firÅ¿t entrance into our ChriÅ¿tian warfare.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the Å¿ubiect matter whereupon this diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayming and forÅ¿aking is to be employed, it is a troupe of encompaÅ¿Å¿ing and beÅ¿ieging enemies all too neere vs, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round about vs, and partly within vs. The Diuell, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿ible foe, moÅ¿t powerfull by his own Å¿ubtilty and malice, he Å¿etteth vpon vs by Å¿uggeÅ¿tions to draw vs to his works. Verely none of them can be good, for hee can doe nothing but Å¿inne, and would make vs like himÅ¿elfe. He employeth theÅ¿e workes and workemen when hee breatheth into our Å¿oules the helliÅ¿h paÅ¿Å¿ions of preÅ¿umption, deÅ¿peration, pride, malice, murther of Å¿oules and bodies: contention of Religion, AtheiÅ¿me, HereÅ¿ie, &amp;c. For the influence of Å¿pirituall wickedneÅ¿Å¿es, hee vÅ¿eth among all other inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Å¿trongeÅ¿t againÅ¿t our owne Å¿oules, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall purblind reaÅ¿on, to wound our Faith: he hence whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and kindleth his fiery darts.

            <p>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> This AnÅ¿wer is a manifold cord binding the baptiÅ¿ed vnto theÅ¿e three duties. FirÅ¿t, an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obligation to performe in our owne perÅ¿ons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer our Sureties haue vndertaken in our name. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oluble Å¿trength of this bond is euident out of reaÅ¿on and common practiÅ¿e. The rule of Law is, <hi>Quod quis per alium facit, per Å¿e facere videtur.</hi> What a man doth by another, hee is in law taken to doe it by himÅ¿elfe. If I depute a man to <pb n="15" facs="tcp:767:23"/> Å¿eale a bond for mee, his act bindeth me as Å¿ure, as if I had performed it immediately by my Å¿elfe. An oath taken by a Proctor <hi>in animam Domini,</hi> lyeth vpon the Å¿oule of him that authorized the taker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But an infant cannot make any deputation, nor can at all binde himÅ¿elfe, being not of iudgement and diÅ¿creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿o to doe, and therefore it Å¿eemes wee are free, from whatÅ¿oeuer was vndertaken by others for vs at our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> WhoÅ¿oeuer hath capacity of being baptized, muÅ¿t needs haue withall a ioynt ability to vndergoe the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of BaptiÅ¿me, the duty doth inÅ¿eparably accompany the benefit. The Å¿tipulation of others for an Infant, where it is to his benefit, bindeth not onely in the gifts, but in the annexed duties. If a childe haue an hand to take a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall LeaÅ¿e, hee muÅ¿t alÅ¿o finde an hand to pay the rent and performe couenants. Nor doth the Obligation of obedience binde the baptized, meerely by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e made by the God-fathers: though there were no Å¿uch promiÅ¿e made by others for the childe, nor expreÅ¿sly by the party baptized (in caÅ¿e hee Å¿hould then bee of age) yet this holdeth <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> as an inÅ¿eparable condition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Sacrament of baptiÅ¿me: inaÅ¿much as all baptizing is <hi>into the Å¿imilitude of ChriÅ¿ts death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> and implyeth on our part, the couenant of obedience, mortification, and dying vnto Å¿inne. WhoÅ¿oeuer therefore, whether man or childe hath ability to be baptized, muÅ¿t needes withall bee of capacity to vndergoe the couenants of BaptiÅ¿me. Doth BaptiÅ¿me conferre vpon thee the priuiledge of adoption to bee the childe of God? Semblably, it layeth vpon thee the yoake of obedience, to bee the dutifull Å¿eruant of God.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd duty is of proteÅ¿tation and reÅ¿olution to doe and performe in action what wee acknowledge due from vs vpon Å¿uch our Godfathers Å¿tipulation. Fitly therefore follow thoÅ¿e words <hi>By Gods helpe Å¿o I will.</hi> This bringeth the duties home to vs and faÅ¿tneth them not onely in our vnderÅ¿tanding; but in our wills and affections. Many <pb n="16" facs="tcp:767:24"/> are content to profeÅ¿Å¿e this obligation, but the moÅ¿t are Å¿low to achieue this reÅ¿olution.</p>
            <p>A third following duty is of Prayer, and that in both kinds: FirÅ¿t, thankeÅ¿giuing to God for calling vs to this bleÅ¿Å¿ed eÅ¿tate; and then, petition for the grace of perÅ¿eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Thankes to God is here firÅ¿t in order of nature; for who, conÅ¿idering himÅ¿elfe to bee made the childe of God, doth not at the firÅ¿t apprehenÅ¿ion breake forth into the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Gods goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and glorifying his bleÅ¿Å¿ed name for Å¿uch vnÅ¿peakable mercy, before he dare preÅ¿ume to begge a further guift from the Å¿ame hand? Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> in moÅ¿t of his EpiÅ¿tles beginneth with commemoration of Gods fundamentall mercies in ChriÅ¿t, and thanks for them before hee proceed to new Petitions for continuance of Å¿auing graces. ThankÅ¿giuing to God for grace, is the fruit of the firÅ¿t grace, and the Å¿eed of the latter.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, petition for Gods grace, for continuance in grace; Å¿heweth,</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, that it is not in our power to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h our Å¿elues, but that wee muÅ¿t craue this bleÅ¿sing of him, who is the firÅ¿t Author and laÅ¿t finiÅ¿her of our faith, by whoÅ¿e power wee are kept and confirmed vnto Saluation, namely, the Å¿ame power and mercy by which wee are firÅ¿t taken out of the iawes of hell, as I haue Å¿hewed before in handling the ability of forÅ¿aking the Diuell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the difference heerein appeareth, betweene the two eÅ¿tates of grace and glory, the imperfection of this life, and the abÅ¿olute PerfectneÅ¿Å¿e of a better. Heere we are Å¿till to intreat, <hi>Lord increaÅ¿e our faith:</hi> Lord Å¿trengthen our hope: Lord aÅ¿siÅ¿t our patience. But there wee Å¿hall not need to make requeÅ¿t for eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment: our faith Å¿hall then bee euacuated, by accompliÅ¿hment; our hope fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by fruition; our patience needleÅ¿Å¿e, where there Å¿hall bee no tribulation. There the exerciÅ¿e of the Å¿oule Å¿hall be in admiring, adoring, and magnifying that mercy and bounty, which hath preÅ¿erued vs to the end of our mortall liues, and hath crowned vs with life euerlaÅ¿ting.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:767:25"/> Å¿ome Commentaries vpon this of the ApoÅ¿tles. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall is the Nicene Creede, made Å¿ome three hundred yeeres after ChriÅ¿ts Incarnation, vnto which were conÅ¿enting 318, Fathers,
<hi>ConÅ¿tantine</hi> the great Emperor being PreÅ¿ident. This (becauÅ¿e of
<hi>Arius,</hi> who denied ChriÅ¿ts Diuinity) is larger in Å¿etting this forth, how hee is very God of very God, and of the Å¿ame Å¿ubÅ¿tance with the Father. Next is the <hi>AthanaÅ¿ian</hi> Creede, made by that holy man
<hi>AthanaÅ¿ius,</hi> who by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was much perÅ¿ecuted: but he made this as for a teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his owne Å¿incerity in the truth, Å¿o alÅ¿o to inÅ¿truct and confirme others. And of like Å¿ort is the

Now, forÅ¿omuch as a Commentary of CatechiÅ¿me is in this TreatiÅ¿e intended, I would not willingly leaue any ground of our Religion vntouched, &amp; therefore haue thought it needfull here to inÅ¿ert Å¿ome things more generall, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and then to proceed to the Å¿euerall articles as they lye in order. 1.

Now this is to be read, not onely in the booke of conÅ¿cience; but Å¿econdly, in the booke of Gods iudgements, taking notorious wicked men oftentimes, in the very inÅ¿tant of their Å¿inning, and Å¿ingling out guilty perÅ¿ons by lots, as <hi>Achan,</hi> and <hi>Ionah,</hi> and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diÅ¿couering murthers, &amp; other villanies, that they might not eÅ¿cape vnpuniÅ¿hed.

                  <hi>Explan.</hi> In the handling of theÅ¿e Articles of our Faith par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, my purpoÅ¿e is to followe one, and the Å¿ame method throughout, viz. FirÅ¿t to Å¿hewe the meaning of the words, then the ground of holy Scriptures, out of which they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and laÅ¿tly, how wee are to expreÅ¿Å¿e in our liues, our faith in euery Article.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t therefore touching the Å¿enÅ¿e of this Article. <hi>I beleeue,</hi> that is, I my Å¿elfe doe particularly know, and beleeue whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <pb n="27" facs="tcp:767:29"/> is here Å¿et down, and acknowledge it my duty Å¿o to doe, and not to reÅ¿t contented with a generall faith, beleeuing, as the Church beleeueth, without knowing the things beleeued: or with a generall faith beleeuing theÅ¿e things generally to be true, without applying them to my Å¿elfe.<note place="margin">

To proceed, <hi>I beleeue that God is my Father:</hi> that is, I doe not onely beleeue, that God is the Father of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, nor that he is onely the Father of all things by creation, but that he is my Father by adoption and grace, and that I am his childe, though by nature I be the child of wrath: Å¿o that he is a Father by generation, by creation, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or adoption. My Father able to doe all things, that is all things, which it pleaÅ¿eth him, all things, that are arguments of infinite power, without excluÅ¿ion of the Sonne, or holy GhoÅ¿t, for the Sonne alÅ¿o is able to doe all things, and Å¿o is the holy GhoÅ¿t, and thus I beleeue him to bee the creator of the world alÅ¿o, and the gouernour, for that this is aÅ¿cribed vnto the Father, as his proper worke, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of the Sonne, is the redemption of his people, and the proper worke of the holy GhoÅ¿t their Å¿anctification, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being excluded from hauing to doe in the worke of creation, redemption, and Å¿anctification.

<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.16.</note>Secondly, for the grounds of this Article, and firÅ¿t, that God is a Father, and firÅ¿t by generation. Hence it is, that he calleth IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Sonne. <hi>Thou art my Å¿onne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi> and his firÅ¿t borne. <hi>When hee bringeth in his firÅ¿t begotten, hee Å¿aith, Let all the Angels worÅ¿hip him,</hi> and,

Secondly, in regard of litle or rather no paines taken hereabout, for he Å¿pake but the Word, and all was made, he did but Å¿ay of euery thing, let it be, and it was Å¿o. Thirdly, in regard of the inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tooles vÅ¿ed, which were likewiÅ¿e none. Fourthly, in regard of the time, all things were finiÅ¿hed in Å¿ix dayes, not that the Lord needed this time, for he could haue made all in an inÅ¿tant, but partly, that we might enter into a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct, and particular conÅ¿ideration of all his glorious works, to Å¿et forth his praiÅ¿e: partly, that his prouident care ouer man might appeare, for that hee prepared all things fit for him before his creation, to Å¿tirre vp the greater care of his glory, in man: partly, to make knowne his Å¿oueraigne power ouer all creatures, when as hee cauÅ¿ed light to bee without <pb n="29" facs="tcp:767:30"/> Sun, Moone, or Starres, &amp; trees, plants to growe without the influence of theÅ¿e heauenly bodies, Å¿hewing hereby, that howÅ¿oeuer he doth vÅ¿e meanes ordinarily, yet hee is not tyed hereunto, but can, and will, if it pleaÅ¿e him, worke all things without meanes, that wee might learne to relye vpon his helpe, when we are deÅ¿titute of all meanes of comfort; and laÅ¿tly, to giue example of labouring in our callings the Å¿ixe dayes, and Å¿anctifying a reÅ¿t vpon the Å¿euenth.

For, howÅ¿oeuer hee is Å¿aid to haue become fleÅ¿h, to haue beene made man; which may Å¿eeme to imply a conuerÅ¿ion, or confuÅ¿ion of Å¿ubÅ¿tances; yet hee is elÅ¿e-where Å¿aide,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.

               <p>Now of all thoÅ¿e, that which Å¿tands for <hi>Limbo</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded; as by other Å¿ound poÅ¿itiue reaÅ¿ons drawne from Scriptures: Å¿o in regard alÅ¿o of the impertinency of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alleadged: for in that to the Hebrewes: <hi>The way into the holieÅ¿t was not yet opened,</hi> is meant nothing elÅ¿e but that, which in more words is there expreÅ¿Å¿ed,
<hi>viz.</hi> heauen and happineÅ¿Å¿e, the redemption of man, as verÅ¿e 12. was not obtained by the Å¿eruice done in this tabernacle: and in the other, theÅ¿e dying <pb n="60" facs="tcp:767:46"/> receiued not the promiÅ¿es, is meant, the incarnation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿o long before, and Å¿o often promiÅ¿ed, but not Å¿ent in their times.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd interpretation Å¿eemeth to mee too much Å¿trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and maketh this Å¿hort Creed needleÅ¿ly to labour with tautologie, for what elÅ¿e can this import, He was buried, that is, laid in the graue, and deÅ¿cended into hell, that is, went downe into the graue, as if it had beene Å¿aid, He was buried, and was buried.</p>
               <p>The third not much different from this, and onely Å¿heweth that this his buriall was not a meere tranÅ¿eunt act or paÅ¿sion but had a due continuation by his body Å¿o remaining, <hi>in Å¿tatis quo,</hi> till his reÅ¿urrection, which me thinkes is Å¿ufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the Å¿pecifying of his buriall and riÅ¿ing the third day, importing that for that
<hi>interim</hi> his body lay Å¿till in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</p>
               <p>The fourth interpretation hath farre more probability, this Creed being compoÅ¿ed by thoÅ¿e, who fitted it not onely to the Greeke Å¿tile, (in which language it was written) but alÅ¿o to the Hebrew ordinary phraÅ¿e, which Å¿oundeth in this faÅ¿hion, Å¿peaking of a dead man, namely, that he is dead and gone downe into <hi>Sheol,</hi> which whether you tranÅ¿late, hell or the graue, or Å¿ome place of bliÅ¿Å¿e, it doth not heereby Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any of theÅ¿e diÅ¿tinctly, but onely pointeth at the Å¿tate and condition of the dead in generall, and conÅ¿idereth them by a confuÅ¿ed motion, as oppoÅ¿ite to the Å¿tate of the liuing heere vpon earth. So that by this conÅ¿truction, heere is to bee meant, that our Sauiours, not body onely, but Å¿oule alÅ¿o did for this meane Å¿pace vndergoe the common lot of Å¿eparation the one from the other, and Å¿o remained in the ordinary eÅ¿tate of others departed this life. HowÅ¿oeuer it bee yeelded that this phraÅ¿e may well beare this Å¿enÅ¿e; yet becauÅ¿e both thus much is implied in the generall word of ChriÅ¿ts being dead, (which muÅ¿t needs meane a true death, putting him in the common condition of other deadmen) and foraÅ¿much as theÅ¿e words of deÅ¿cent, &amp;c. doe rather import Å¿omewhat added to his death and buriall, the more currant expoÅ¿ition is to make it a Å¿euerall and different Article or Parcell of our Sauiours <pb n="61" facs="tcp:767:46"/> performances: and Å¿o wee will now conÅ¿ider in the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning interpretations.</p>
               <p>That branch of the firÅ¿t interpretation, auouching that our Sauiour did Å¿ometime <hi>in triduo mortis,</hi> really deÅ¿cend in Å¿oule into the place of the damned, is moÅ¿t literall, naturall, and agreeable to the words, no way lyable to tautologie, nor repugnant to the analogie of Faith; but conÅ¿orting with the plaine termes of Scripture and teÅ¿timony of ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

FirÅ¿t it is to be acknowledged, whereÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is found out by the markes before Å¿poken of; thus the Church at Rome, was once famous all ouer the world; and <hi>Peter</hi> indeauoured much, after that he had once beene with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the Gentiles;<note place="margin">Rom. 1 8 Act 12.5.6</note> to bring the Church of the Iewes to acknowledge them to bee the Church of God alÅ¿o: and indeed, how otherwiÅ¿e can I Å¿ay, <hi>I beleeue the Church?</hi> Which is firmely to hold, and conÅ¿tantly to acknowledge it.

LaÅ¿tly, this further appeareth, from the conÅ¿ideration of the manner, how things haue beene carried from time to time, in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿ometime according to the will of one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, King, or Pope, and Å¿ometime of Å¿ome few, and that not Å¿incerely, but apparantly Å¿eeking themÅ¿elues, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Å¿atisfie their malicious mindes. I Å¿hould dwell too long here, if I Å¿hould enter into a particular exemplification of this: it is Å¿o plaine to all that read of their proceedings, as that it cannot be denied. FirÅ¿t, Å¿omething hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by an higher power, then a Councell called, and his minde being divulged, they feare to appeare, that be of a contrary opinion, or if they appeare, they are not admitted into the Councell, or through feare recanting, are receiued; &amp; Å¿o it is proceeded to the matter propounded. Then a great Å¿hewe is made, of calling vpon the Spirit of truth, for his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, but all is concluded, according as was before conceiued: and accordingly is taught in the Churches; and thus the people of God, vnder the pretext of Councels, is Å¿educed. Which things being Å¿o, let the Reader iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church viÅ¿ible may not eaÅ¿ily erre: Å¿eeing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, from whence things there held doe proceed, is thus troubled and filthy. Againe, admit that freer councels, which repreÅ¿ent the Church, bee called (which cannot be granted to haue beene in the Roman Church, certaine hundreds of yeeres laÅ¿t paÅ¿t) yet who be they that make vp councels? are they not men: that I may not Å¿ay, men altogether intangled with voluptuous liuing, aÅ¿piring after nothing but honours &amp; filthy lucre for the moÅ¿t part? &amp; what aÅ¿Å¿urance, I pray you can we then haue that they cannot er? yea, what feare may we not iuÅ¿tly haue, that they haue altogether erred?

Let the Reader therefore Å¿eeke aboue, and hee Å¿hall finde all theÅ¿e things more fully laid open, by arguments and reaÅ¿ons, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, HiÅ¿tories, and obÅ¿eruations. It is time now to proceed to the tenth Article, Å¿etting downe the fourth thing to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued concerning the Church.</p>

                  <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> 43. Which is the fourth thing, which you learne to beleeue concerning the Church?</p>
               <p>AnÅ¿w. <hi>Fourthly, I learne to beleeue, that there be certaine Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall benefits belonging to the Church, and to euery true member ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> viz. The Communion of Saints, the forgiueneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes, the reÅ¿urrection of the body, and the life euerlaÅ¿ting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> 44. What meane you by the Communion of Saints?</p>
               <p>AnÅ¿. <hi>That holy and Å¿weet fellowÅ¿hip, which all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bers of ChriÅ¿ts Church haue one with another; as they make all but one body in ChriÅ¿t, Å¿o communicating of all good things vnto one another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirituall or Temporall, as their mutuall neceÅ¿sities doe require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Expla.</hi> After the deÅ¿cription of the true Church of God by the markes, here followeth the comfortable, and bleÅ¿Å¿ed eÅ¿tate thereof Å¿et downe in theÅ¿e Priuiledges: <hi>The Communion of Saints &amp;c.</hi> that no man may thinke it loÅ¿t labour, either to Å¿eeke out the true Church, or to endeauour to ioyne himÅ¿elfe vnto the Å¿ame. For the meaning of this firÅ¿t priuiledge: <hi>The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints</hi> is as much in effect, as their common vnion vnto ChriÅ¿t their head, and through him vnto God the Father, and of one vnto another, euen as there is an vnion betwixt members <pb n="140" facs="tcp:767:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Å¿ame body, which vnion Å¿tretcheth not onely to the Church militant, howÅ¿oeuer diÅ¿pearÅ¿ed, but euen to the Church triumphant alÅ¿o, and the Saints in heauen. So that firÅ¿t in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the communion of Saints. I doe hold, and acknowledge that none in the world of what company or degree Å¿oeuer, are Å¿o highly aduanced, and Å¿o happy for the fellowÅ¿hippe, into the order of which they are ioyned, as the Saints are, as they which are of the company of Gods Church and people; BecauÅ¿e that they may happily bee ioyned to men famous vpon earth, but theÅ¿e are ioyned to the holy ones placed in heauen; they may be ioyned to Princes, and men great vpon earth, but theÅ¿e are ioyned to the King of Kings, to the greateÅ¿t both in earth, and in heauen. Secondly, the communion of Saints is as much, as their communicating with their head IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and with one another, whereby ChriÅ¿ts merits and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e are made common vnto them, and their Å¿innes and miÅ¿eries vnto him: and their prayers, faÅ¿tings, and deuotions are made common vnto one another, not only amongÅ¿t the liuing, but euen amongÅ¿t the liuing, and the Saints departed alÅ¿o; and laÅ¿tly, whereby tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and outward things of this life are made common vnto them, through ChriÅ¿t, who is heire of all things, Å¿o as that they only haue true right, and title before God vnto earthly things. I doe then in the Å¿econd place here acknowledge, and beleeue that no Å¿mall good comes of this communion, but Å¿uch as the world cannot afford; for my Å¿ins are laid vpon ChriÅ¿t, and his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e Å¿erueth to cloath me, if I be in miÅ¿ery, hee is not without Å¿enÅ¿e and feeling thereof, but what is done againÅ¿t mee, he accounts it, as done againÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe: Moreouer the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and daily prayers of all good people aÅ¿cend vp for me, if I be afflicted they grieue, if in welfare they ioy, yea, the Saints in heauen cry to God for the Å¿hortening of our daies of miÅ¿ery: LaÅ¿tly, though mine eÅ¿tate bee neuer Å¿o poore in this world, yet I am richer then many, that haue great poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿sions, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vÅ¿urpers, but I hauing right vnto my poore cloathes, and Å¿lender diet, &amp; vnto more, as God Å¿hall be pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿end it me: and if I be rich, I communicate vnto the neceÅ¿sities of Gods children, and thus prouide me riches, that Å¿hall neuer periÅ¿h, or be loÅ¿t.</p>

What Law of the Iudicialls of the Iewes; nay, what Ciuill Law almoÅ¿t at all in any orderly Common-wealth throughout the world, tendeth not to the maintaining Å¿ome Morall Law, and forwarding Å¿ome duty concerning the liues, goods, chaÅ¿titie, good name, peace, and iuÅ¿tice of, and among our neighbors? muÅ¿t therefore the Lawes (I meane the iuÅ¿t and honeÅ¿t lawes) of all other Nations bind vs? muÅ¿t the Å¿ame penalties in euer Å¿eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offence be currant through the world? Surely I know no Law for that. Generall equitie is diuerÅ¿ified by particular, and not onely due puniÅ¿hments, but alÅ¿o offences are truly greater and leÅ¿Å¿er in varietie of times, places and people, eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e actions, which conÅ¿erue the more remote parts and skirts of the Morall Law.

                  <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements deuided into two Tables.</note> and herein therefore doe all Writers agree, both ancient and moderne, both ProteÅ¿tant and PopiÅ¿h, the onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is about the right diÅ¿tinction of theÅ¿e Commandements. For Å¿ome haue placed fiue in either Table, as the Iewes, <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>IoÅ¿ephus,</hi> learned Writers amongÅ¿t them: Some haue placed three in the firÅ¿t Table, and Å¿euen in the Å¿econd, as Å¿ometime <hi>AuguÅ¿tine</hi> did, to expreÅ¿Å¿e the myÅ¿terie of the Trinitie: but the PapiÅ¿ts doe it at this day, to defend their Idolatry, and yet to keepe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ten, they deuide the laÅ¿t Commandement into two; and Å¿o doe the Lutherans. Some againe diuide them by foure in the firÅ¿t Table, and Å¿ixe in the latter, as almoÅ¿t all ancient Greeke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Athanatius, Origen, Gregorius, Nazianzenus, ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tomus,</hi> &amp;c. and Å¿ome Latines, as elÅ¿ewhere,
<hi>AuguÅ¿tine, Hierom, AmbroÅ¿e, Sulpitius,</hi> &amp;c. But this controuerÅ¿ie might Å¿oone be ended, if men would bring their religion to Gods Law, and not Gods Law to their religion, as they of the Roman Church doe. For if the firÅ¿t table bee the firÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t Commandement of the Law, teaching vs to loue the Lord with all our heart; and the Å¿econd be like vnto it, teaching our duty towards our neighbour, how we Å¿hould loue him, as our Å¿elues, as ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe hath taught, then it is without doubt, that all which teach the loue of God, belong to the firÅ¿t; and all which teach our duty towards our neighbour, belong to the Å¿econd Table. Which being Å¿o, and foure diÅ¿tinct things giuen in charge, touching the loue of God; and Å¿ix touching our neighbour, and no more, how can the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinction fitly be otherwiÅ¿e made, but into foure and Å¿ix? Againe, let the laÅ¿t Commandement be well conÅ¿idered, and it will eaÅ¿ilie appeare to be but one, euen all that, which forbiddeth coueting, both becauÅ¿e it toucheth but one thing onely, and is againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in a different order, in the booke of Deuteronomy, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not couet thy neighbours wife,</hi>

                     <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</note>The Å¿econd rule is this; Euery negatiue commandement doth bind alwaies, and vnto all times: euery affirmatiue doth onely bind alwaies, but not vnto all times alÅ¿o, as for example: <hi>Thou Å¿halt not haue no other Gods but me:</hi> the affirmatiue of hauing the Lord for our God doth bind alwaies, Å¿o that he Å¿inneth; whoÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer at any time denieth the Lord in his heart, or doth contrarie to the feare or loue of God: but hee Å¿inneth not, that doth not actually exerciÅ¿e theÅ¿e affections at all times, becauÅ¿e that a man Å¿ometime Å¿leepeth, Å¿ometime through the violence of diÅ¿eaÅ¿es looÅ¿eth the vÅ¿e of his reaÅ¿onable Å¿oule, many times alÅ¿o is poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed with vehement thoughts which employ the mind another way; and laÅ¿tly, occaÅ¿ions are not at all times offered to try our hearts. The fourth Commandement in the affirmatiue hath, <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day:</hi> againÅ¿t this hee Å¿inneth, whoÅ¿oeuer doth breake the Sabbath: but he Å¿inneth not, that doth not keepe it at all times, and parcels of times, becauÅ¿e the weakeneÅ¿Å¿e of our natures requireth Å¿ome reÅ¿t and pauÅ¿e, at what time we cannot be buÅ¿ied in holy exerciÅ¿es. The like is to bee Å¿aid of honouring our parents &amp;c. But come to negatiue Commandements, and you Å¿hall Å¿ee, that whoÅ¿oeuer ceaÅ¿eth from obÅ¿eruing them at any time, is a Å¿inner; for example; <hi>Thou <pb n="193" facs="tcp:767:113"/> Å¿halt doe no murther,</hi> is a negatiue command: and Å¿o is, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not commit adultery:</hi> if any man then Å¿hall murther at any time, or be adulterous, whether he be drunken or Å¿ober, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry or quiet, tempted or not, in whatÅ¿oeuer place, time or occaÅ¿ion, hee is a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or, and this diÅ¿tinction is Å¿et forth amongÅ¿t, Schoole-men, by the termes of
<hi>Å¿emper</hi> and <hi>ad Å¿emper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Rule is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule.</hi>
3.</note> Euery commandement forbidding any Å¿inne, doth not onely forbid the Å¿inne named, but all Å¿ins of the Å¿ame ranke alÅ¿o, and all occaÅ¿ions of the Å¿ame; and the maine Å¿inne onely is named, to make the branches the more odious, as being of the Å¿ame nature before the Lord. Thus ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe interpreteth the Å¿ixth, Å¿eauenth, and third commandements, where reprouing the PhariÅ¿ees doctrine,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> only forbidding murther, and the act of adultery, and falÅ¿e Å¿wearing by Gods holy name, he teacheth, that euen vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiÅ¿ed anger is a Å¿inne, and to looke vpon a woman to luÅ¿t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her is adultery, and to Å¿weare any oath at all in ordinary communication, is from the Diuell, by which we may gather how we are to vnderÅ¿tand the other commandements alÅ¿o.</p>

Thus they which truÅ¿t in men are idolaters, and the people of IÅ¿rael are often Å¿harply reproued for Å¿o doing, the Prophet Å¿ometime threatning them for their more groÅ¿Å¿e outward idolatry, Å¿ometime for this more Å¿ecret, and inward by truÅ¿ting in the King of Aegypt, and Ethiopia.

<hi>Haman</hi> did, and therefore is there none end of their inÅ¿olencies: and alÅ¿o Å¿uch as truÅ¿t to HorÅ¿es, and weapons, Å¿hips and CaÅ¿tles, and other furniture for the warres, none are Å¿o bold as theÅ¿e in the time of peace, and none Å¿o forÅ¿aken in the day of danger, and Å¿o cowardly, and the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e their God, in whom they truÅ¿ted, the arme of fleÅ¿h, appeareth to be a vaine thing to Å¿aue a man. LaÅ¿t and worÅ¿t of all are witches and Wizards, and all Å¿uch as Å¿eeke vnto them in their Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, or loÅ¿Å¿es, theÅ¿e are expreÅ¿Å¿e idolaters, haue palpably changed their God, and therefore the true God hath commanded, that they Å¿hould not bee Å¿uffered to liue.

But wee muÅ¿t here take heede, that wee make not this Commandement Å¿tricter, then the Lord hath made it, to caÅ¿t a Å¿nare vpon the conÅ¿ciences of men: it is true, that as the Image, Å¿o the Image-maker, and Image-worÅ¿hipper are alike abominable, and Å¿o bee all Å¿uch, as wittingly labour about any ornament, or imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Å¿etting forth of Idolatrie. But God forbid, that euerie Image and Image-maker, Å¿hould bee therfore accounted abominable; for Å¿o the excellent Art of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Å¿eruing in liuely colours Å¿o to expreÅ¿Å¿e our friends ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, as if they were euer preÅ¿ent with vs, and picturing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emblemes of vertue and vice, for ornament and delight, Å¿hould cleane bee put downe, and our very coyne were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
               <p>Therefore here are firÅ¿t to be excepted, ciuill pictures, for the delight and comfort of the beholder: Å¿econdly, all Å¿uch as Å¿erue for Å¿ome remembrance, tending to our inÅ¿truction, for vertue, or vice, for wit, policy, diÅ¿cretion and diligence.

Of this commemoratiue nature, was the vÅ¿e of the tranÅ¿eunt Å¿igne of the CroÅ¿Å¿e in baptiÅ¿me, amongÅ¿t the moÅ¿t ancient Fathers in the purer times.

That which is the Lords peculiarly, &amp; perpetually, &amp; not by any new ordination for a time, that is to be paid alwaies, without al difference of times of the old and new TeÅ¿tament: but Å¿uch are tithes, they are the Lords, &amp; not made Å¿o by any Å¿uch ordination, therefore they are to be paid euen vnder the new TeÅ¿tament alÅ¿o. It cannot be maintained, that tithes are ceremonial, or appurtenances of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:767:203"/> PrieÅ¿thood: for God, though he gaue them to the Leuites, yet did he not firÅ¿t found them in that encorporation: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferred his owne right to that Order of PrieÅ¿t-hood <hi>quouÅ¿que,</hi> Å¿o long as it Å¿hould endure, and after the ceaÅ¿ing of that PrieÅ¿t-hood, the Å¿ame right deÅ¿cended, as it were, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to the Å¿ucceeding MiniÅ¿tery of the GoÅ¿pell.

And if <hi>per impoÅ¿sibile,</hi> the GoÅ¿pell could ceaÅ¿e, yet Å¿hould not tythes ceaÅ¿e, but be rendred to whatÅ¿oeuer MiniÅ¿tery could be feigned to Å¿ucceed in place thereof.</p>

Hence it is that the lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, though they be recorded in the Scriptures, yet they are not taxed in thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons, becauÅ¿e it was to Å¿aue life, not to deÅ¿troy; to fulfill things pleaÅ¿ing vnto God, not againÅ¿t his will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The pernicious lye, is the telling of an vntruth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and to hurt a mans neighbour, either for Å¿ome baÅ¿e gaine, or out of malice. This is a common practice amongÅ¿t tradeÅ¿men, and buyers and Å¿ellers of all Å¿orts, and amongÅ¿t Sycophants before Å¿poken of. But it is an eÅ¿Å¿entiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Diuell, and makes them the children of the Diuell, at which all Å¿hould quake and tremble: <hi>Hee is a lyer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the Father of lyes.</hi> He deceiued <hi>Adam</hi> and

               <p n="3">3. The ieÅ¿ting or Å¿porting lye, is the telling of things not true for the recreation of the hearer, hauing none other end of morality; or it is to tell vntruths, to make a gull of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or to Å¿port and pleaÅ¿e a mans Å¿elfe and his own vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humour.

For though ChriÅ¿t were miÅ¿vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood of the woman of Samaria, touching the water that he Å¿pake of, &amp; by his DiÅ¿ciples touching the temple that he could deÅ¿troy, &amp; raiÅ¿e vp againe in 3. dayes, yet he had no meaning to deceiue by thus Å¿peaking, but to remoue their minds from carnal to Å¿pirituall conceits, betwixt which and the IeÅ¿uites equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there is no more proportion, then betwixt heauen and hell.</p>
               <p>And the Å¿ame is to be Å¿aid of the ApoÅ¿tles, Å¿peaking wordes that might be taken two wayes, or in two diuers Å¿enÅ¿es: Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reÅ¿eruations are Å¿uch anÅ¿wers, as wherein Å¿ome clauÅ¿e is reÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the minde of the anÅ¿werer, making the anÅ¿wer true, how contrary Å¿oeuer the words are to the truth.</p>
               <p>For example, it being demanded, Did you not come late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from beyond the Å¿eas? he anÅ¿wers, no, though hee did, with this mentall reÅ¿eruation, to paÅ¿Å¿e into Scotland, Poland, &amp;c. Did you Å¿ay or heare maÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ince you came into England? hee anÅ¿wers no, when he did, with this mentall reÅ¿eruation, I did it not to tell you. O Å¿trange deuice to mocke men, and God; this is a degree beyond <hi>Beelzehubs</hi> inuention, neuer the like heard of before in any age Be aÅ¿hamed heereof, euen yee firÅ¿t-borne of Satan, yee IeÅ¿uites, vnleÅ¿Å¿e yee will take vpon you to be tutors to your owne father.</p>

               <p>Thus, if this prayer be Å¿aid, it is well vÅ¿ed alone, or added to other prayers: like vnto a wraÅ¿tler, who hauing vÅ¿ed his beÅ¿t skill and Å¿trength, to ouercome in his wraÅ¿tling, yet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the victory, getting to bee very hard, hee re-inforceth himÅ¿elfe at the laÅ¿t, with all his might, force and skill, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that he may carry away the prize: Å¿o the ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man wraÅ¿tling, as <hi>Iaacob</hi> with God by prayer, in the end re-inforceth himÅ¿elfe in this prayer, that he may not depart vnbleÅ¿Å¿ed.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="AnÅ¿w."/> It is true indeed: wee know not of our Å¿elues, as naturall men, what to aske, but the Spirit of God teacheth vs, partly enlightening vs by the Word of God, and partly Å¿tirring vp this heauenly motion in our mindes, to pray, and long after the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of Gods grace, which is an argument of our full deliuerance from mortality and baÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e, into perfect glory of Å¿oule and body, and this onely is the Å¿cope of the ApoÅ¿tle in that place. Againe, becauÅ¿e prayer is the worke of Gods Spirit, it may bee hence gathered, that all Å¿uch as haue the Spirit, and are regenerate, doe and are able in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure to pray, to their owne comfort, hauing none other helps of prayers made by men, or aforehand deuiÅ¿ed by themÅ¿elues.

                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.9. </note>Whence it followeth, that a wicked man liuing in Å¿inne, cannot pray, Å¿eeing he, which is borne of God, Å¿inneth not, who only is indued with the Spirit of Prayer.

                  <note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt praying and wiÅ¿hing.</note>1. BecauÅ¿e wiÅ¿hes are Å¿udden and inconÅ¿iderate, Å¿traight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ceaÅ¿ing as a ball rebounding, when it is at the higheÅ¿t, it falleth againe; prayer is with deliberation, and giueth not ouer without Å¿peeding of the thing deÅ¿ired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WiÅ¿hes are without reÅ¿pect of the meanes and care of right or wrong, in attaining the thing wiÅ¿hed for: Prayer is with Å¿ubmisÅ¿ion to the vÅ¿e of the meanes, and care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing by right onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WiÅ¿hes, are for the moÅ¿t part of things worldly, I would I had Å¿uch an houÅ¿e, Å¿uch riches, &amp;c. prayer, is chiefly for things Å¿pirituall, and heauenly, one only petition of Å¿ixe being for things temporall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WiÅ¿hes are Å¿ometime for things Å¿pirituall and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but very inconÅ¿tant as <hi>Balaams</hi> wiÅ¿h, and that of
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> pray vnto God that none of theÅ¿e things befall mee: prayer perÅ¿euereth, as <hi>Iaacob</hi> wreÅ¿tling heereby, will not let God depart vntill that hee yeeldeth to bleÅ¿Å¿e him.</p>

                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:767:232"/>Furthermore, as a wicked man cannot pray, Å¿o his Å¿aying of prayers is an abhomination to the Lord. Of the wicked Iewes
<hi>IncenÅ¿e is abhomination to me,</hi> Å¿aith the Lord: and <hi>The Å¿acrifice of the wicked,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is abomination to the Lord. The King, or Å¿ome noble perÅ¿on would diÅ¿daine it much, to bee waited vpon at the Table with Clownes all miry, and dirty, and the King of heauen is no leÅ¿Å¿e offended, if any wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire of Å¿inne, come to giue attendance vpon him in prayer. Woe then to wicked perÅ¿ons, that will, Å¿teale, whoore, prophane the Sabbath, drinke, oppreÅ¿Å¿e, and kill, and yet come and worÅ¿hip in the Lords HouÅ¿e. This is Å¿o abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, that euen naturall men, and Pagans doe abhorre it in ChriÅ¿tians. <hi>Penda</hi> an heathen king of the Mercians,<note place="margin">Hovvs Chron. pag. 67.</note> would not Å¿uffer any ChriÅ¿tians, that liued contrary to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion to goe vnpunniÅ¿hed: So the Turke doth at this day. See then here the horrible eÅ¿tate of wicked men, pray they ought, it being a common duty of all men, and yet pray they cannot; yea, they Å¿inne, if they pray, Å¿uch a maze or Labyrinth doth Å¿inne bring them into.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, from the perÅ¿on, vnto whom we are directed to pray, wee learne, if wee bee Å¿uch, as can rightly call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to come with all boldneÅ¿Å¿e, and confidence vnto him. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿ometime, and moÅ¿t commonly Å¿etteth foorth, the firÅ¿t perÅ¿on in Trinity: Å¿ometime, but very rarely, the Å¿econd, as where the prophet Å¿aith, <hi>Hee Å¿hall call his name Emmanuell,</hi>

                  <hi>Ought we not much more bee Å¿ubiect to the Father of Spirits?</hi> We may therefore pray vnto the whole Trinity, but more properly vnto the firÅ¿t perÅ¿on, God the Father, in the name of God the Sonne, by the aÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance of God the holy GhoÅ¿t.

He is the Soueraigne Lord of all, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of him ought to Å¿way all; the greateÅ¿t men are not Å¿o to be reuerenced Å¿imply for their power and greatnes, but for him,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.28.</note> and in him; <hi>I will tell you</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) whom yee Å¿hall feare, <hi>not him that can kill the body, but him that can deÅ¿troy body and Å¿oule in hell fire.</hi> And this is the argument vÅ¿ed by the ApoÅ¿tle, to perÅ¿wade obedience to the higher powers,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>becauÅ¿e there are no powers but of God, and the powers that are, are of God</hi> Euen as the riuers come from the Å¿ea, and runne into the Å¿ea, Å¿o all mens greatneÅ¿Å¿e, and that they are men, commeth from God, and ends in God. If God commandeth any thing, he is to be heard for his commands Å¿ake; if man commandeth any thing, he is to be heard for Gods Å¿ake, which if it were Å¿o, Å¿inne Å¿hould not Å¿o much haue the vpper hand: but this is turned amongÅ¿t the men of this age, into the contrary, man is heard, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erued for himÅ¿elfe, God for man, a plaine euidence, whereof is the obedience of the moÅ¿t vnto great perÅ¿ons and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and neglect of Gods poore MiniÅ¿ters armed only with the Word, the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the firÅ¿t, and maine thing by the Lord intended

And this will make euery one, that is an obedient Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the King of heauen, with ioy to beare any croÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o that God may haue glory, to account all loÅ¿Å¿e, which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his diÅ¿honour. For if the maine eÅ¿tate of any man bee Å¿afe, he is the leÅ¿Å¿e troubled at Å¿mall loÅ¿Å¿es; but much leÅ¿Å¿e if hundreths of pounds bee daily added hereunto, and his loÅ¿Å¿es be but Å¿ome few pence: no more ought wee to be much troubled at our owne loÅ¿Å¿es, or croÅ¿Å¿es, Å¿eeing the maine, Gods glory, is hereby greatly increaÅ¿ed.</p>

And in like manner ought wee to bee affected to Gods glory in euery duty Å¿eeking this firÅ¿t, and chiefely, and not to be Å¿eene of men, as the PhariÅ¿ees.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25. </note>Fourthly, we craue iuÅ¿tification, through the death &amp; bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hedding of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
<hi>who was deliuered to death for our Å¿innes, and roÅ¿e againe for our iuÅ¿tification:</hi> that the Lord would not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require our Å¿innes at our hands, either holding vs guiltie, or puniÅ¿hing vs therefore in this world, or in the world to come, but that the Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t may be a perfect attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for vs, and his precious blood effectuall to clenÅ¿e vs from all Å¿inne. Now of this iuÅ¿tification there are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the firÅ¿t, whereby of Å¿inners wee are made righteous, in the very act of our conuerÅ¿ion: the Å¿econd, whereby our daily infirmities and failes are done away, and wee are Å¿till notwithÅ¿tanding them reputed righteous. The firÅ¿t we pray for and deÅ¿ire to be confirmed in it, through Gods grace, that our eÅ¿tate may be comfortable: the Å¿econd wee pray for, as wee haue need to preÅ¿erue our peace and comfort, when wee view our eÅ¿tate before God. Euen as a bankrupt debter fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great fauor with his creditors to forgiue his great debts, and being ready Å¿till daily through his extreame want to run vpon the Å¿core againe, is a daily Å¿utor for mercy vnto them, to continue this their fauour in forgiuing all.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, wee pray for loue and charity towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, through which wee may bee ready to forgiue them their treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es againÅ¿t vs: for our heart naturally is a corrupt fountaine, and wee are implacable when wee are offended, <pb n="476" facs="tcp:767:255"/> eÅ¿pecially if it be Å¿pitefully done againÅ¿t vs, or by an enemy. Wherefore wee pray, that when wrongs are done vnto vs, we may conÅ¿ider, how much, and often wee haue offended the Lord, to what griefe of his holy Spirit, and with what hatefull hearts, preferring Sathan and his Å¿eruice before the Å¿eruice of the heauenly MaieÅ¿ty: that as we would notwithÅ¿tanding haue all this forgiuen vnto vs, wee may frame our minds to forgiue the greateÅ¿t offences againÅ¿t vs, hee which hath done them acknowledging his fault. Thus ChriÅ¿t being asked, <hi>Should I forgiue my brother, if he Å¿inneth againÅ¿t me Å¿eauen times in a day?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth 18.21.</note> anÅ¿wereth, <hi>If he turneth againe, and Å¿aith, it repenteth me, I Å¿ay not vntill Å¿euen times, but vntill Å¿euenty times Å¿euen times.</hi> And for this cauÅ¿e he bringeth his Parable of the Lord, forgiuing ten thouÅ¿and of talents to his Å¿eruant; but finding him with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to exact the hundreth pence due vnto him from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Å¿eruant, Å¿hewing hereby how vaine all our prayers are for the pardon of our Å¿innes againÅ¿t God, if we refuÅ¿e to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the Å¿innes of our fellow-Å¿eruants againÅ¿t vs. Let no man therefore deceiue himÅ¿elf, by keeping malice, and Å¿eeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon men for wrong done vnto him, but through loue let him forgiue all: for if there be not this loue towards his brother, there is no loue towards God, and then it is Å¿ure, that God beareth no loue towards him, his loue of God being an inÅ¿eperable reflexion of the Å¿un Å¿hine of Gods loue vpon him: euen as a blind man may aÅ¿Å¿uredly know, that the Sunne doth not Å¿hine vpon him, becauÅ¿e he feeleth no warmth thereby in his body.</p>

               <p>AnÅ¿w. <hi>It is added as a reaÅ¿on of all the Petitions to Å¿trengthen our faith, that God being both able and willing doth grant all our requeÅ¿ts made vnto him in the name of ChriÅ¿t, and therefore in the end we put to a note of confidence, and Å¿ay, Amen.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Explan.</hi> Here we haue alÅ¿o to be obÅ¿erued the order, the Å¿enÅ¿e, and the Å¿cope of this concluÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the order, it followeth all the Petitions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth <pb n="488" facs="tcp:767:261"/> a kind of promiÅ¿e to giue glory to God, and to bee thankfull, our requeÅ¿ts being granted; whence wee learne, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to obÅ¿erue the Lords dealing towards vs, when wee haue called vpon his name, how graciouÅ¿ly he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and helpeth vs, that out of a Å¿peciall apprehenÅ¿ion of his former mercies, wee may build aÅ¿Å¿ured confidence of future, and be duely thankfull to his holy name. Thus
<hi>Dauid</hi> kept a RegiÅ¿ter of the Lords dealing towards him, and is confident againÅ¿t the Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> and for thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e it is required as much as prayer.<note place="margin">PÅ¿al. 50.14.</note>

                  <hi>Deborah, Barak, SamÅ¿on,</hi> and all the faithfull. The not obÅ¿eruing of Gods mercies granted at our requeÅ¿t, blunts the edge of our zeale this way, and cauÅ¿eth, that the Lord hath none but a formall thankÅ¿giuing at our hands, which is abominable: it maketh vs without confidence and feruency, triuiall and idle in our prayers, euen as an idiote or Å¿enÅ¿eles man, that hath not reaÅ¿on to know, note, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his benefactors, and Å¿uch as doe for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Å¿enÅ¿e of the words. <hi>Thine is the Kingdome,</hi> that is both generall ouer the world, and Å¿peciall ouer the Church and choÅ¿en, neither is there any kingdome, but is ruled by thee, as by the Å¿upreme conÅ¿titutor, and appointer thereof, and in this faith doe we pray vnto thee, Å¿ubmitting our Å¿elues, as thy Å¿ubiects and liege people.
<hi>The power;</hi> that is, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, whereby thou art able to doe all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer thy people aske and beg of thee, there is nothing out of thy power, neither life nor death, things preÅ¿ent, nor things to come, no power can withÅ¿tand thee, either of men or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, but thou art able to doe for vs, mauger them all; wee are without all power and might in our Å¿elues to help our Å¿elues, wee know not what to doe, but our eyes wait vpon thee.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. </note>FirÅ¿t, from the Kingdome of God. A good King, louing and kind to his Å¿ubiects, is eaÅ¿ie to be intreated of them, and is delighted with their life and welfare: but thou art the beÅ¿t King of all; we thy Å¿ubiects who do craue nothing but things needfull for vs, and tending to our welfare: therefore thou wilt be intreated. And the Å¿trength of the reaÅ¿on lyeth in the firÅ¿t part, that a good King tendreth the good of his people, which wee Å¿hall find to bee true in all good Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who deÅ¿ired, when the plague raged amongÅ¿t his people. <hi>Let thy hand, Lord, bee againÅ¿t mee, and againÅ¿t my fathers houÅ¿e, theÅ¿e Å¿heepe what haue they done?</hi> And in
<hi>Samuel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnkindly reiected by the people; yet being in their danger, deÅ¿ired to pray for them: <hi>God forbid,</hi> Å¿aith hee,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that I Å¿hould Å¿inne againÅ¿t the Lord, and ceaÅ¿e praying for you.</hi> Yea, Å¿ome Heathen Kings haue excelled herein, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>eÅ¿paÅ¿ian,</hi> who was Å¿o delighted in doing good vnto his people, as that if hee had let Å¿lippe any day, without doing Å¿ome Å¿peciall good for Å¿ome man he would Å¿ay, <hi>O Å¿ocii, per didimus diem, O fellowes, wee haue loÅ¿t a day.</hi> This diÅ¿poÅ¿ition therefore to doe good, muÅ¿t needes bee much more in the beÅ¿t King of Kings at all times.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the power of God wee haue this reaÅ¿on. A King that wanteth no power to doe good vnto his Å¿ubiects, if he be good, will aÅ¿Å¿uredly doe for them in all their neceÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but thou, O Lord, art Å¿uch a powerfull King, nothing can hinder, or reÅ¿iÅ¿t thy good pleaÅ¿ure. Therefore thou wilt <pb n="490" facs="tcp:767:262"/> doe theÅ¿e things for vs. Euery part of this reaÅ¿on is euident, for nothing but ability can hinder a mercifull Lord from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his humble Å¿eruants, hee being <hi>Parens patriae, the father of the country,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and a father, being Å¿o ready as the Lord Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to doe good vnto his children when they aske of him: and as for this King, his power is infinite, he doth whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleaÅ¿eth him in heauen and earth; hee is all-Å¿ufficient to defend <hi>Abraham</hi> in Å¿trange countries, <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Padam Aram, Dauid</hi> in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, and <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whales belly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may build aÅ¿Å¿ured confidence of his mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">PÅ¿alm 19. </note>Thirdly, from the glory of God we haue this reaÅ¿on. Hee that being a great King regarding his glory aboue al things, will readily doe whatÅ¿oeuer may redound to his honour and glory: but thou (O God) art thus regardfull of thy glory, it being aboue all things tendred by thee: therefore wee doubt not but thou wilt grant theÅ¿e things, of which thou Å¿halt haue Å¿o much glory. The Å¿trength of this reaÅ¿on lieth in the Å¿econd part, that God doth principally regard his glory, and that by granting our requeÅ¿ts, hee Å¿hall haue glory. The firÅ¿t is plaine, both by the moÅ¿t excellent workes of creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption &amp;c. which Å¿erue to manifeÅ¿t his glory, according to that of the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t.
<hi>The heauens declare the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> and according to that of the ApoÅ¿tle, who Å¿peaking of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tination and redemption,<note place="margin">EpheÅ¿. 1.6.</note> Å¿aith, that it was, <hi>to the praiÅ¿e of the glory of his grace.</hi> And it is plaine alÅ¿o by his dealings, honoring Å¿uch as honour him, and bringing downe Å¿uch as take honour to themÅ¿elues, that hee onely may bee exalted in that day. Againe, that God hath glory by granting our requeÅ¿ts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; for that our firÅ¿t and chiefe requeÅ¿t is, that God may bee glorified, and our deÅ¿ire is, by being heard in all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿ts, to haue matter of prayÅ¿ing and magnifying his holy name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, from the eternity of theÅ¿e things, for euer and euer, wee may reaÅ¿on thus. A moÅ¿t glorious and excellent King, out of whoÅ¿e power nothing is, who remaineth Å¿uch for euer, is euer alike graciouÅ¿ly diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to his Å¿ubiects: but God is a moÅ¿t glorious King and powerfull for euer, in all times and ages alike, and hath heretofore heard the requeÅ¿ts <pb n="491" facs="tcp:767:262"/> of Å¿uch as faithfully haue called vpon his name: therefore he is Å¿till likewiÅ¿e ready to do for vs, granting all our petitions. The firÅ¿t part of this reaÅ¿on is plaine, becauÅ¿e that he to whom no change is incident, the caÅ¿e being alwaies alike, cannot be changeable in his grace and fauour. The Å¿econd part is alÅ¿o euident, for God is hee
<note place="margin">Reuel. 1.8. Heb. 13.8.</note>
                  <hi>which is, which was, and which is to come; yea IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the Å¿ame yeÅ¿terday and to day, and for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his grace in times paÅ¿t, and readines to heare the prayers of Å¿uch as haue faithfully called vpon him, no age hath been without large teÅ¿timony. <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treÅ¿Å¿e, and was heard, Å¿o that of a man naked and deÅ¿titute, hee was made rich, and had great droues of cattell. <hi>IehoÅ¿aphat</hi> prayed, and had victory ouer his enemies, when he knew not what to doe; Å¿undry diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed and blind perÅ¿ons both in body and Å¿oule prayed, and were healed, and had their Å¿innes pardoned, wherefore wee need not to doubt, but that we alÅ¿o are heard in our deÅ¿ires.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, from our confidence, expreÅ¿Å¿ed in the laÅ¿t word
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> we may reaÅ¿on thus. The Lord will grant vnto vs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer we belieue Å¿hall be granted, when we aske: but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue when we aske theÅ¿e Petitions; for we Å¿ay <hi>Amen</hi> in hart, verily wee are perÅ¿waded that it Å¿hall bee Å¿o; therfore they are granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Marke 9.23. </note>The firÅ¿t part of this reaÅ¿on, it is the Å¿aying of our Lord, <hi>WhatÅ¿oeuer yee aske if yee belieue, it Å¿hall bee done vnto you:</hi> for the Å¿econd, if wee diÅ¿Å¿emble not, but haue our heart going with our tongue, wee doe belieue, and therefore are the more confident to Å¿peed of our deÅ¿ires.</p>
               <p>But more eÅ¿pecially of theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, The firÅ¿t hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Å¿econd Petition, the Å¿econd to the third, the third to the firÅ¿t, the fourth to the fourth and fift, the fift to the laÅ¿t Petition. From hence ariÅ¿e theÅ¿e two concluÅ¿ions.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, that they which learne aright to pray are moÅ¿t hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleÅ¿Å¿ed, they build good Å¿peed and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e in all their deÅ¿ignes vpon the Å¿ureÅ¿t foundation in the world, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, glory, eternity and fidelity of the Lord: and therefore, as theÅ¿e Å¿hall not faile, Å¿o Å¿hall not their labours in <pb n="492" facs="tcp:767:263" rendition="simple:additions"/> prayer and Å¿upplication. In any attempt without this there is none aÅ¿Å¿urance; the builder, watch-man, Å¿eedÅ¿-man, build, watch, and caÅ¿t Å¿eede vpon the ground in vaine, in vaine are barnes pulled downe, and made greater, and fruits and goods heaped vp without profit, only he that maketh faithfull prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doth it not in vaine. Let euery man then apply himÅ¿elfe to this exerciÅ¿e, and learne to doe it aright, by the peruÅ¿ing and due conÅ¿ideration of theÅ¿e, and the like meditations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the firÅ¿t beginning of all things is from God, Å¿o their end alÅ¿o is in him, to Å¿et forth his Kingdome, power, and glorie for euer, and therefore it Å¿hall bee our wiÅ¿edome in all things alwaies to reÅ¿pect God, to come to him, to walke with him, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; and with <hi>Dauid</hi> Å¿ay in all things, <hi>Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but vnto thy name we giue the glory.</hi> If we aime at any other thing, we Å¿hall be diÅ¿appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if wee go from God, and haue not him in our waies, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or not, we Å¿hall be brought vnto him; hills and mountaines laid vpon vs, Å¿hall not couer vs, but we muÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure his angry preÅ¿ence, and as from a moÅ¿t Å¿euere Iudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our iuÅ¿t doome:
<hi>Goe yee curÅ¿ed into hell fire prepared for the Deuill and his Angels,</hi> and euen by this will he haue glory.</p>

               <p>Wherfore repentance is neceÅ¿Å¿ary in all Å¿uch as would haue their baptiÅ¿me effectuall to confirme Gods mercy vnto them: &amp; there muÅ¿t be a generall turning from Å¿inne in theÅ¿e that come to be baptized, Å¿o after baptiÅ¿me there is a daily practiÅ¿e of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by confeÅ¿Å¿ion, contrition and reformation. For euen after BaptiÅ¿me we are Å¿till Å¿ubiect to Å¿inne, though we Å¿triue and fight againÅ¿t Å¿inne, daily the fleÅ¿h leading vs captiue to the law of Å¿in: to be deliuered from which, we muÅ¿t make a daily practiÅ¿e of Repentance, but the Å¿eale of BaptiÅ¿me is no more to be itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Euen as a Å¿eruant being once bored through the eare by his MaÅ¿ter, without iterating this, remained his Å¿eruant for euer; but if he offended, was chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed and reformed often: Å¿o he that is once truely baptized, remayneth Gods Å¿eruant for euer; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e he doth often offend, he muÅ¿t be chaÅ¿tized and reformed by Repentance.</p>

Since in the peace of the Church, the Communion hath been three or foure times in the yeare, and Å¿pecially at EaÅ¿ter, as Å¿uccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the PaÅ¿Å¿eouer.

Not to aske them therefore (which is but loÅ¿t labour) what the benefit is, wee Å¿ay, that it is the Å¿trengthening and refreÅ¿hing of the Å¿oule. More diÅ¿tinctly, whatÅ¿oeuer benefit redoundeth to the corporall life from the Bread and Wine, the like redoundeth here-from to the worthy receiuer, by vertue of ChriÅ¿ts body and bloud, as before hath been particularly declared.

               <p>There be theÅ¿e two parties in all couenants, otherwiÅ¿e they cannot Å¿tand, Å¿omething aÅ¿Å¿ured and giuen, and Å¿omething taken and receiued therefore: So betwixt Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; the Prince giueth and aÅ¿Å¿ureth his care in ruling, and prouiding well for the good of the Subiect, hee receiueth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <pb n="544" facs="tcp:767:289"/> cuÅ¿tome and obedience: Å¿o betwixt maÅ¿ters and Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, betwixt Å¿ellers and buyers, lenders and borrowers.</p>
               <p>In like manner in this Couenant God for his part aÅ¿Å¿ureth, and giueth himÅ¿elfe to be our gracious God, forgiuing all our treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, and on our part, he muÅ¿t receiue tribute, Å¿ubiection and obedience, otherwiÅ¿e the bond is forfeit, and if it hath bin Å¿o once, twiÅ¿e, or often, and the forfeit hath not yet been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, take heed of the next time, for if thou Å¿till remaine vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, not better keeping couenants, hauing renewed them Å¿o many times, there is no hope for thee to bee dealt withall, but as with a deÅ¿perate perÅ¿on, that thou Å¿houldÅ¿t Å¿uddenly be deliuered to Å¿ome infernall Å¿pirit, the Taylor, and Å¿o be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oned in Hell, whence thou canÅ¿t neuer come out againe.</p>

                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>oly Scriptures are Gods word. </note>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> AmongÅ¿t all arguments there is none of that force in the conÅ¿cience of man; that this is of being taken from the diuinitie of the holy Scriptures. For let it appeare that they are of God, and what heart dares doe any other but yeeld vnto them? Now, that they are of God, may bee plainely prooued by Å¿undry reaÅ¿ons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:767:291"/>FirÅ¿t, by their Antiquitie; for the firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t ancient writings in the world concerning Religion, muÅ¿t needs be Gods, but theÅ¿e are the firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t ancient; therefore muÅ¿t needs be Gods.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the moÅ¿t ancient are Gods Scriptures, is plaine; becauÅ¿e otherwiÅ¿e either Å¿ome other InÅ¿tructor muÅ¿t haue beene before God: or elÅ¿e God, the Ruler of the whole world, muÅ¿t haue beene without any thing recorded, whereby the world ought to be ruled, till that man had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented Å¿omething to gouerne man by; both which are moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd.</p>
            <p>That the holy Scriptures are moÅ¿t ancient, appeareth by the moÅ¿t ancient humane writers. <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the firÅ¿t of all, writeth of the two Tables deliuered to <hi>MoÅ¿es.</hi> Whence he Å¿aith, that he learned what he knew of God. <hi>Linus</hi> wrote of the Tower of Babylon deÅ¿cribed by <hi>MoÅ¿es, &amp;c.</hi> making plaine heereby that the Bookes of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> were long before any of their writings, and Å¿o the moÅ¿t ancient in the world. Hence it is that <hi>Tacianus</hi> affirmeth that it appeareth out of <hi>BeroÅ¿us</hi> a <hi>Caldee</hi> Writer,<note place="margin">Tatiani Oratio aduerÅ¿us gentes, MoÅ¿es fuit Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho antiquior &amp; plurimis diis gentium <hi>Clem. Alexandr.</hi>
               </note> out of the writings of the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians and Annales of the Egyptians, that <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> wrote long before <hi>Orpheus, Linus, Amphyon, Homer,</hi> or the moÅ¿t ancient Ethnickes. Now the Bookes of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole Scriptures, all that followeth tending one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the further explanation heereof. Wherefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are moÅ¿t auncient, and conÅ¿equently the vndoubted word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is further prooued by the preÅ¿eruation of the Scriptures in all ages, other ancient Bookes being periÅ¿hed either in part or in whole, but the holy Scriptures, though more oppugned then any by perÅ¿ecutors, who haue Å¿ought to blot out the memory of them, yet are wholly preÅ¿erued without diminution or corruption of any part of them. Had they beene of man, certainly it would haue happened vnto them as vnto many other humane writings, which are moÅ¿t ancient: which, if they haue not periÅ¿hed, yet they haue been falÅ¿ified: yea, one complaineth, that hee himÅ¿elfe yet

               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleuerunt. The Brethren requeÅ¿ting I wrote EpiÅ¿tles, theÅ¿e the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles of the Deuill haue filled with tares, adding Å¿ome things, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away otherÅ¿ome.</hi> Now the holy Scriptures haue been Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly preÅ¿erued heerein, in the hands of the Iewes, who haue miÅ¿liked Å¿ome things, and forbidden them to be read, as <hi>Daniel,</hi> becauÅ¿e he Å¿peaketh Å¿o plainly of the MeÅ¿siah: in the hands of the heathen, as when at the requeÅ¿t of <hi>Ptolomee</hi> they were tranÅ¿lated by the Septuagint, and in the hands of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, who haue corrupted Fathers and Councels, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer durÅ¿t, but haue beene reÅ¿trained from heauen, from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is further proued by the miracles which haue been wrought to confirme the Scriptures to be of God, the Author of all true miracles: of this Å¿ort are the miracles wought by <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> by the Prophets, by ChriÅ¿t, and by his DiÅ¿ciples. For all theÅ¿e miracles doe plainly teÅ¿tifie of them, that they were Å¿ent of God; and if they were of God, then the word by them Å¿et forth is the word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Å¿ame is proued by the propheÅ¿ies contained in the Scriptures, Å¿ome being of things to come to paÅ¿Å¿e many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeares after, as that the Å¿eed of the woman Å¿hould breake the Å¿erpents head, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> poÅ¿terity Å¿hould be numberleÅ¿Å¿e, that they Å¿hould be Å¿trangers 400. yeares, that <hi>JoÅ¿iah</hi> Å¿hould burne the bones of <hi>Baals</hi> PrieÅ¿ts where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did Å¿acrifice, that the people of IÅ¿rael Å¿hould be in captiuity 70. yeares, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿ely forenamed, Å¿hould giue them leaue to returne and diuerÅ¿ly honour them, &amp;c. From hence we may reaÅ¿on thus: ThoÅ¿e Scriptures which in their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations exceed all the vnderÅ¿tanding of all creatures, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly his who is aboue all creatures, that is Gods: but Å¿uch are the holy Scriptures, as appeareth by theÅ¿e &amp; the like PropheÅ¿ies.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. for no created vnderÅ¿tanding can of it Å¿elfe reach to things to come, to Å¿ay certainly thus it Å¿hal be: Å¿ome may coniecture, or being appointed as inÅ¿truments of execution may declare what themÅ¿elues Å¿hall performe, as <pb n="550" facs="tcp:767:292"/> the Deuill did to <hi>Saul,</hi> but God onely hath made it Å¿o proper to himÅ¿elfe to foretell independently, abÅ¿olutely, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what Å¿hall come afterwards, as that it may well be Å¿aid, <hi>Let them tell what Å¿hall come, let them doe good or euill, and Å¿ay that they be Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Å¿ame is further proued by the Argument handled in the Scriptures, which is altogether graue &amp; holy, tending to the Å¿etting forth of all vertue, and againÅ¿t all vice, wheras (as <hi>IuÅ¿tine Martyr</hi> hath obÅ¿erued) the writers of the Heathen gods and religion,<note place="margin">IuÅ¿tin Martyr.</note> were either ridiculous Poets, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue the beginning of all from the waters, &amp; handle the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and filthy loues of the gods: or PhyloÅ¿ophers more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: for that the very chiefe of them were vncertaine of the beginning of things. Now Å¿uch as the writing is, Å¿uch muÅ¿t needs be the Author from whom it firÅ¿t commeth; true it is, that he which is vnholy may write things holy &amp; good, but then they come not from him, but firÅ¿t from Å¿ome other fountaine: therefore the moÅ¿t holy, who is God, muÅ¿t needs be the Author of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is proued by the teÅ¿timony of Heathen men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues. The Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> againÅ¿t Images, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the chiefe religious Emperour amongÅ¿t the heathen Romans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of. <hi>Numenius</hi> a <hi>Pythagorean;</hi> PhyloÅ¿opher Å¿aith of <hi>Plato,</hi> that hee was none other but <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> Å¿peaking in the Atticke tongue.<note place="margin">EuÅ¿eb. de prepar.

Tribellius Pollio</hi> writing of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> Å¿aith, that hee was the only man familiar with God. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth the truth of that HiÅ¿tory in <hi>Exodus,</hi> telling how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many plagues, let the children of IÅ¿rael goe, though hee thruÅ¿t in Å¿ome abÅ¿urd fabulous lyes concerning the Iewes. <hi>Procopius</hi> teÅ¿tifieth of
<hi>IoÅ¿hua,</hi> that for feare of him the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> left their country. <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> write of the Creation of the world in Å¿ixe dayes. <hi>Ouid</hi> of the generall deluge, as alÅ¿o of the Gyants rearing of mountaines vp to heauen, which is an alluÅ¿ion to the Tower of Babell. <hi>Abidenus, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billa</hi> and <hi>Hestiaeus</hi> of the long liues of the Ancients. <hi>Epolemus</hi> 
               <pb n="551" facs="tcp:767:292"/> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and how he fought for <hi>Lot. Plato</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth, that he learned the moÅ¿t excellent precepts of wiÅ¿dom of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, (meaning
<hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and the Prophets.) Now whence commeth this conÅ¿ent of men of contrary minds to the truth of the Scriptures? Verily, from Gods prouidence, that no man might deny that, which by the light of nature is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged of naturall man, <hi>viz</hi> the truth and Diuinitie of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Å¿ame is proued by the Å¿ingle drift of the Scriptures, which is only, to giue all glory to God, nothing to man, Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the faults of the beÅ¿t are ingenuouÅ¿ly and without flattery Å¿et downe; neither is any mans fauour affected or Å¿ought for in any of theÅ¿e books, which cannot be Å¿aid of any humane writings.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Å¿ame is proued by the conÅ¿ent of all the books of holy Scripture, though written by diuers men at Å¿undry times. Neuer was the like to be found touching mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but euen the Å¿ame Author hath been oftentimes noted to differ from himÅ¿elfe. Wherefore the Writers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures were vndoubtedly guided by one Å¿pirit of truth, and what they wrote came from this Å¿pirit which is God. If any differences Å¿eeme to be in theÅ¿e holy writings, this is, through the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of our conceit and miÅ¿vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, and not indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> 147. Hauing this Word of God written, is it not Å¿ufficient for our Å¿aluation without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, euen as to haue a Booke of Statutes, Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to be kept from the danger of the Law, to thoÅ¿e that will?</p>
            <p>AnÅ¿w. <hi>It is not Å¿ufficient, but it muÅ¿t alÅ¿o bee Å¿et forth by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that the hard places may bee rightly vnderstood, wee may bee kept from errours, and haue our dull hearts Å¿tirred vp to imbrace the holy precepts hereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Explan.</hi> Many there be who acknowledge the Scriptures to be Gods word; but doe not Å¿o much regard the preaching <pb n="552" facs="tcp:767:293"/> of this word, proÅ¿uming vpon their owne ability, to make a good vÅ¿e of it in priuat by reading, for their edification, and Å¿aluation. And Å¿ome colour of reaÅ¿on there is alÅ¿o for this, Å¿eeing that the word Å¿erueth to acquaint vs with the wil and law of God, as a Å¿tatute booke, with the Lawes of the land; and knowing theÅ¿e Lawes, if we will not obey, all preaching cannot bring vs to obedience, or doe vs more good. But this is a deceitfull colour. FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e a Statute book is not like vnto Gods booke, that being humane, and the penalty Å¿enÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this diuine and Å¿pirituall; and not vnderÅ¿tood by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: Å¿o that a man may read much here, but remain Å¿till as deÅ¿titute of vnderÅ¿tanding,<note place="margin">Actes
8.</note> as the Eunuch who asked, <hi>How can I vnderÅ¿tand without an Interpreter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, becauÅ¿e preaching is the meane by which God hath wrought in all ages, and will principally and moÅ¿t po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully worke by this ordinarily for our Å¿aluation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.18. 1 Pet. 2, 2. </note>Thirdly, becauÅ¿e no man can receiue the word to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, vnleÅ¿Å¿e he reuerence and eÅ¿teeme of the preaching ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Å¿eeing that the word it Å¿elfe doth Å¿o highly commend and vrge to attend to preaching.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauÅ¿e the Lord, who onely can giue light by his word, doth direct Å¿uch as be in darknes, to the Preachers of his word,
<hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> the
<hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Philip &amp;c.</hi> refuÅ¿ing otherwiÅ¿e to giue them any light.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, becauÅ¿e men are naturally dull and backward to that which is good, when they know it, Å¿o that reading only they are Å¿till frozen in their Å¿ins: it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that by the exhortation of preaching they Å¿hould bee Å¿tirred vp, and by the zeale and heat of others bee warmed and become agile and chearefull to doe accordingly.</p>
            <p>In all things wee Å¿ay for comfort, <hi>Two are better then one:</hi> and why Å¿hould it not be Å¿o in this alÅ¿o? A man reading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is forgetfull, and letteth it flip Å¿oone out of his mind which he readeth: a faithfull MiniÅ¿ter of Gods word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him, and bringeth continually to his remembrance; hee is like a Å¿ticke lying by a firebrand ready to goe out; the MiniÅ¿ter Å¿tirres vp the fire, and layes the Å¿tickes together, he
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:767:293"/> hath bread by him, but is feeble, becauÅ¿e he cannot breake it in pieces to eate Å¿ome of it, the MiniÅ¿ter breakes it vnto him for his comfort.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to exerciÅ¿e the hearing of this Word preached, beÅ¿ides the priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, and hee that hauing the meanes, contemneth them, wandreth Å¿till in Å¿inne and blindneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

               <hi>QueÅ¿t.</hi> 148. What is the preaching of the Word of God?</p>
            <p>AnÅ¿. <hi>It is properly the expounding of Å¿ome part thereof, the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence the duties to be followed, and the Å¿innes to be auoided, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to doe accordingly.</hi>

But the preaching of the word to Å¿peak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is more then all theÅ¿e, as may appeare both by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e in the dayes of
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when it is Å¿aid, that the PrieÅ¿t Å¿tood vpon a place higher then the people, <hi>and read the Law of God plainely, and expounding the Å¿ence gaue the vnderÅ¿tanding of the Scriptures.</hi> And alÅ¿o in the new TeÅ¿tament, where after the Lecture of the Law and the Prophets, it is Å¿aid, that the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogue Å¿ent to <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoÅ¿e with him, Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Act. 13 15.</note>

            <p>Now for reading the Scriptures (though in a large Å¿enÅ¿e it be a kind of preaching, becauÅ¿e that the truth is hereby Å¿et forth, and the GoÅ¿pell, and meanes of Å¿aluation made known to him that readeth, or heareth it read; yet it is properly no more preaching, then reading is an Oration; neither is hee that doth thus any more a Preacher, then Å¿uch an one, an Oratour. For when the queÅ¿tion is made, whether reading <pb n="554" facs="tcp:767:294"/> be preaching? it is not meant, whether by reading is not the truth Å¿et forth, and may not Å¿auing grace be wrought in the hearers? but whether reading bee the preaching practiÅ¿ed by the MiniÅ¿ters of Gods word vnder the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament, which is Å¿o much commended for the liuely opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being Gods Å¿pecial and greateÅ¿t ordinary power to Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; and whether the reading bee that which wee haue charge to intend, when we are bidden, go preach the GoÅ¿pel? For vnleÅ¿Å¿e they Å¿triue to make their reading Å¿uch a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they queÅ¿tion about nothing, if to make it Å¿uch a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching they Å¿triue againÅ¿t the Å¿treame, the whole current of examples recorded in the Word, being againÅ¿t them: yea, that Å¿peciall place, which they think a moÅ¿t Å¿ure ground for them. <hi>MoÅ¿es hath of old Å¿uch as preach him, when he is read in their Synagogues euery Sabbath day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15.26.</note> doth plainely rebuke their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Å¿eeing that it may well be hence gathered, that at all times vpon the Sabbath, when the PrieÅ¿ts read <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> they expounded and gaue light vnto the people by teaching, as in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> daies. Much more might bee Å¿aid for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute of Å¿uch groÅ¿Å¿e opinions; but becauÅ¿e I propounded to bee briefe in all things, thus much Å¿hall Å¿uffice briefly for this.</p>
            <p>Let vs all lay aÅ¿ide partiality, whereby wee are carried to fauour our Å¿elues, and Å¿eeke our owne eaÅ¿e, and this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fountaine of Å¿uch troubled opinions being dammed vp, I doubt not but wee Å¿hall with one conÅ¿ent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to preach in another manner, then by reading and familiar talking, applying our Å¿elues to the right vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures, that we may giue the right Å¿enÅ¿e, after the Å¿enÅ¿e, find out Å¿ound and profitable doctrines, Å¿trengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good reaÅ¿on, conuincing the iudgement, and after the doctrines, frame Å¿ome forcible exhortations, to bring and bow the affections to the light Å¿et vp in the vnderÅ¿tanding, that Gods people may haue more grace, and his holy name more glorie.</p>

Good Lord Å¿anctifie vs, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e vs now aright, Å¿eeing by thy prouidence we are this day to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emble and meet together in thy houÅ¿e, that the beames of this light may Å¿hine amongÅ¿t vs. Forgiue vs all our Å¿innes, purge, and waÅ¿h vs with the blood of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, that euen as the IÅ¿raelites being waÅ¿hed and Å¿anctified, Å¿aw thy glorie vpon the mount, Å¿o we may be fit to come into the Å¿ame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of glory. DiÅ¿pell in vs the thicke clouds of natural dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, that ouer-Å¿pread the eye of our mind, Å¿o that the light, though moÅ¿t cleare, cannot breake forth vnto vs: remoue that hardneÅ¿Å¿e of heart, which maketh vs inÅ¿enÅ¿ible, and without feeling, either of thy moÅ¿t grieuous threatnings, <pb n="570" facs="tcp:767:302"/> or of thy gracious promiÅ¿es: Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e in vs all inordinate affections of anger, malice, hatred, and enuy; emptie vs of pride, worldlineÅ¿Å¿e, vanity and prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e, that as new borne babes we may deÅ¿ire the Å¿incere milke of thy word, to grow thereby. Put into vs due conÅ¿ideration, that we may take heed to our feete when we enter into thy houÅ¿e, and not offer the Sacrifice of fooles. Thus diÅ¿poÅ¿e vs (O Lord) to thy publike Å¿eruice; and becauÅ¿e a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe, thy Sabbaths are defiled by vanity, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployment, euen when wee are gone from thy houÅ¿e, (mercifull Father) reÅ¿traine vs here-from, helpe vs to conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate this day, as glorious vnto thee: and to be Å¿ober in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, holy in conference, and talking, heauenly in meditation, Å¿eeking in all things the beÅ¿t edification of our Å¿elues and others. Open our hands to the neceÅ¿sities of our poore brethren, and our hearts to haue compaÅ¿sion vpon Å¿uch as Å¿uffer, and be in miÅ¿ery. That in all we may be to the praiÅ¿e of thy name, keeping a moÅ¿t holy reÅ¿t, and in thy good time come to reÅ¿t with thee in thy holy mountaine, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day Å¿hall be a Sabbath, and time of vnÅ¿peakable delight vnto vs for euer and euer, through IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t our Lord and Sauiour.

               <p>MOÅ¿t gracious God, the fountaine of all goodneÅ¿Å¿e, wee deÅ¿ire with thankfull hearts to acknowledge, that as at all times, Å¿o eÅ¿pecially this day, euen Å¿treames of thy grace haue flowed vnto vs to refreÅ¿h vs, when we were drie. Thou haÅ¿t led vs to thy houÅ¿e, thou haÅ¿t Å¿et thy doore open vnto vs, thou haÅ¿t heard our prayers and Å¿upplications made for our Å¿elues, and for the reÅ¿t of thy Church Militant vpon earth: Å¿uffer them not (O Lord) to returne empty vnto vs, though comming from polluted lips, and hearts full of many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Receiue them as Å¿weetned with the precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenÅ¿e of thy Son our Sauiours paÅ¿sion, and perpetuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sion. Thou haÅ¿t fed vs there with Manna from heauen, by
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:767:302"/> the miniÅ¿try of thy holy word: thou haÅ¿t vouchÅ¿afed thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence vnto vs, filling vs with ioy &amp; gladnes, thou haÅ¿t giuen vs to belieue, to abhor Å¿inne, and imbrace thy grace, though we are aÅ¿hamed of our inconÅ¿tancy, and too little profiting, in regard of the meanes of Å¿o long a time. O Lord, Å¿uffer not this to bee as an vntimely birth in vs, or as the graÅ¿Å¿e vpon the houÅ¿e top, that neuer commeth to perfection, but worke in vs conÅ¿tancy and perÅ¿euerance, that where any grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, it may be continued and perfited in the day of the Lord, and where it is not begun, it may be in thy good time. Open our eyes Å¿till more and more to Å¿ee thoÅ¿e things, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the peace and welfare of our Å¿oules, that wee may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fow after them. Giue vs grace to conÅ¿ider the vanity of this world, and of all worldly things, and that the whole duty of man is to feare God and to keepe his commandements, and encline our hearts vnto theÅ¿e, and not vnto couetouÅ¿nes. Let vs not be forgetfull hearers of thy Word, but carefull doers of thy will; let thy Word dwell plenteouÅ¿ly in vs, that as the Scepter of thy Kingdome it may Å¿way vs; as immortall Å¿eed, it may fructifie in vs; as a Å¿word, it may cut vp Å¿inne, and as a pillar of fire, it may guide vs in the night of this world, till we come to the heauenly Canaan. Forgiue the infirmities of this day, our irreuerence in thy worÅ¿hip, our vanity, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and neglect of Å¿o precious time. Let not theÅ¿e things hinder, but that thy word may become the Å¿weete Å¿auour of life vnto vs, but that we may be made hereby fruitfull in all good works, to the honour of thy moÅ¿t bleÅ¿Å¿ed name, through IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t our onely Mediatour and Aduocate.

               <p>MOÅ¿t gracious God, who onely Å¿miteÅ¿t, and art able to heale againe, breakeÅ¿t, and art able to binde vp againe, behold with the eye of compaÅ¿sion mee thy poore Å¿eruant, iuÅ¿tly broken &amp; Å¿mitten with thy rod for my tranÅ¿greÅ¿sions; behold, I Å¿ay, how I lye at the gate of thy mercy, waiting till thy charitable hand bee Å¿tretched out to helpe, and comfort mee: I am a wretched Å¿inner, I confeÅ¿Å¿e, O Lord, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oeuer <pb n="572" facs="tcp:767:303"/> puniÅ¿hment thou doeÅ¿t inflict vpon mee, I deÅ¿erue tenne thouÅ¿and times more at thy reuenging hands, if thou Å¿houldÅ¿t enter into iudgement with me. In my proÅ¿peritie I haue waxed wanton, like a ful fed heifer, lifting vp my heele againÅ¿t thee; I haue giuen my Å¿trength vnto Å¿inne, and not vnto thy Å¿eruice; and although thy word hath been Å¿ounded in mine eares, threatning heauy puniÅ¿hments for my Å¿innes, yet I flattered my Å¿elfe in my heart, Å¿aying, I Å¿hall neuer bee moued. But haue mercy vpon mee, moÅ¿t mercifull Father, for IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t his Å¿ake, remember not theÅ¿e my abuÅ¿ings of thy mercies againÅ¿t mee, but let there bee an healing of my tranÅ¿greÅ¿sions and Å¿ins. Open mine eyes to Å¿ee how greatly I haue offended, in omitting duties commanded, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euils forbidden againÅ¿t thee, and againÅ¿t my brethren, that all my Å¿orrow may be turned into Å¿orrow for Å¿inne, that the iÅ¿Å¿ue hereof may bee repentance vnto Å¿aluation, neuer to be repented of. And (good Father) bee pleaÅ¿ed vpon my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained humiliation, and turning vnto thee, in mercy to turne vnto me againe, Å¿peaking peace vnto my mourning Å¿oule, Å¿aying by thy Å¿pirit that I Å¿hall be comforted. And the cauÅ¿e of all miÅ¿ery, Å¿inne, being remooued out of thy Å¿ight, let my puniÅ¿hment be remoued alÅ¿o. Remember my frailty, O Lord, how that my Å¿trength is not the Å¿trength of Å¿tones, or of iron, that I be not tempted beyond that I Å¿halbe inabled to beare. Temper my bitter cup with Å¿uch faith, patience, and wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as that I may wiÅ¿ely, patiently, and with due Å¿ubmiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion drinke of the Å¿ame, to thy glory, mine owne comfort, and the good example of others. When I am weakeÅ¿t, bee thou Å¿trongeÅ¿t by thy grace in me, and let my prayers in the name of thy deare Å¿on preuaile, as the wreÅ¿tlings of <hi>Iacob,</hi> for a bleÅ¿sing in the middeÅ¿t of theÅ¿e grieuous troubles. Set the the glory of thy Saints before mine eyes alwaies, that I may the better beare theÅ¿e momentany afflictions, which are not to be compared vnto that ineÅ¿timable ioy. Make me Å¿tedfaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to behold the Lord IeÅ¿us heauy vnto the death, wounded, bleeding and dying an accurÅ¿ed death, when hee was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without fault or blame, that I may not bee deÅ¿pairingly caÅ¿t downe, Å¿eeing that I Å¿uffer iuÅ¿tly for my Å¿ins. Giue me <pb n="573" facs="tcp:767:303"/> a due conÅ¿ideration of thy wonderfull loue manifeÅ¿ted in afflictions, to thy children, that I may reioyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Å¿eeing that I am puniÅ¿hed in this world for my amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I may eÅ¿cape the intollerable iudgements of the world to come. Turne mine eyes downward, to Å¿ee how thy holieÅ¿t Å¿eruants, <hi>Iob, Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> with infinite others, haue more deeply taÅ¿ted of this cup of aduerÅ¿itie, that I may not grieue to be Å¿orted with them, who are now in ParadiÅ¿e: with theÅ¿e &amp; the like heauenly meditations Å¿o fill my mind, O Lord, that I may beare my infirmities. And deferre not, but make haÅ¿t to worke my deliuerance, according to thy promiÅ¿e to thoÅ¿e that truÅ¿t in thee. I beleeue, O Lord, helpe mine vnbeliefe, let it not hinder the working of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, the freeing me out of this griefe and miÅ¿ery. Once againe let mee haue Å¿ome reÅ¿pit from my paine that I may praiÅ¿e thee in the land of the liuing, &amp; if through thy mercy I Å¿hall be reÅ¿tored to health and Å¿trength, Å¿o Å¿anctifie this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as that I may Å¿ay, it is good for me that I haue been afflicted, for that I am hereby taught to keepe thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
